"The federal scientist Rick Bright has quit the NIH.""The work of scientists is ignored or denigrated to meet political goals and to advance President Trump's re-election aspirations,"" his lawyers said in an addendum to his May whistleblower complaint.","The President is promoting merit-based immigration, but when it comes to the merit of those who work for him, his only criteria appears to be absolute loyalty. Thank you for speaking out and protecting Americans from 45s debauchery. Speaking truth to power in this administration has serious consequences. I applaud his courage and look forward to him returning to NIH once the  is booted out of the White House.  I hope that all of the talented, dedicated, patriotic people who quit because of trump, will come back to work for Biden.  Mary Ellen O'Connor Amen!!! Mary Ellen O'Connor They will probably go to Canada or Europe where their work and talent is appreciated.

Trump is a tragic self inflicted wound on our country. Everything he touches, he corrupts.  Jaya Polson yeah hope you are staying safe.. Our country has lost so many great career professionals. It sickens me. Phaedra Kimball imagine how bad 4 more years will be for these institutions  Phaedra Kimball I agree Phaedra Kimball they will all be back on January 20th... Phaedra, VOTE! Once 45 is gone, they'll come back. I hate that someone the caliber of Dr Bright felt he had to step down, but I admire his honesty and integrity. So discouraging to have these highly knowledgeable and experienced agency staff drop like flies.... that's hard to recover from.  I sincerely hope Biden wins and we can get to repairing the damage.

"Breaking News: “We need to take away children.” Jeff Sessions and top Justice Department officials pushed hard for migrant family separations in 2018, a watchdog found.","What a fantastic act of ideological larceny, that this party has somehow managed to convince a significant portion of the American public that they are the party of ""morals"" and ""family values"". It truly defies belief. Bryan Fox, Thanks for saying what I'm thinking. To be fair, these are brown children they're discussing, they aren't white kids. Oh, wait, this wouldn't happen to white children, in the trump/Sessions world. Jeffrey Swanson Sher was being sarcastic, saying that Trump's people are only willing to be doing this because the kids are non-white, and that they'd never let it happen to white kids.But, Sher, in reality Trump himself wouldn't care even if they were white because they are in fact poor, and Trump only cares about people who are rich and powerful like him.  EVERYBODY else could literally disappear off the planet and he wouldn't care one iota.  It's apparent in everything he does.  Look at how he treated his Secret Service agents.  He only pretends to care about someone because they're useful tools.  Tools to get elected, tools to help support his position, tools to make him money.  That's it.  Psychologists have pointed this out over and over yet it always seems to get ignored. Bryan Fox Well said. Jeffrey Swanson, I wasn't jesting. Appreciate your feedback. However, they are brown children. They are from different countries, and cultures. These children are precious little people. Would you prefer I say, nonwhite children? I have no idea what you're trying to get at with my calling brown children over white? You seem to get that it's appalling, and you're entitled to be appalled.  Marc Brandenburg, Well said. He's been quoted as saying he's glad COVID happened, as he won't have to shake hands with those disgusting people. Pence' lead task force aide gave us that quote.  Sher Goldesberry ....im not really sure how you meant this comment of yours to be taken...but even in jest your flagrant use of calling children brown over white is appalling... And, yet, the Trumplicans in the House and Senate look the other way. Who ARE these people and why do we need them again in 2020? Bryan Fox Oh my gosh I could not have said it better. Totally agree! It is so bizarre! Bryan Fox. But look how they all falling .  Bryan, that's a Democrat  Sher Goldesberry I find it personally offensive. These children were/are Hispanic. Calling the “brown” children reflects insensitivity Bryan Fox  this is what happens when the conscience is so hardened into depravity. The children will be forever scarred and the parents tragically broken-hearted. Laura Laurel, Hispanic, Latino, Mexican. Calling them Brown children may seem offensive to you, yet it was never meant to be offensive. I used to refer to the kids in cages, as the little Brown children, but that was 3 or 4 years ago.

Innocent children to be specific.  When did this great country lose it's heart and compassion? Judi Veiga Well,  America did the same to Indigenous folks... and then again to Black enslaved folks... and then again to Hispanic folks... seems par for the course. when they decided to pull the lever for a reality-show host  Judi Veiga it’s been mia in all countries for years. Child labor   Poverty. Starvation. Most people have heart and compassion. Too many have none - this caging children.

Judi Veiga 2016 A very long time ago, and the current Australian Govt is following the same path. Arthur Nardini Agreed, and since Miller is a former employee of Sessions it’s no surprise.  Judi Veiga Trump!  He did this Judi Veiga 2016 Keith Harper I'd argue that Indigenous ppl were here when colonizers arrived.  But the removal and ""reeducation"" of their children lasted well into the 1960s.  Judi Veiga #SaveOurChildren Judi Veiga It's despicable! Those in the current administration need to be put in prison for doing this.  Judi Veiga  This isn’t unrecognizable... it’s always been this way. Racial atrocities like these have been the spine of this nation’s history since the beginning.  Judi Veiga yeah but the stock market is up Judi Veiga was America ever really great? Lisa Tate Lovely folks. Carol Holmes and take Mr.  Trump away from his son?  I’m just kidding. Lock him up! Judi, it happened with native Americans, the Japanese, Filipinos, those from India and Southeast Asia and anyone trying to immigrate into the US. I've watched with sadness our horrible history of this atrocity happening again and again on PBS. Keith, no we've done it for as long as we've been a country.  Arthur Nardini Miller also works for Michelle Bachmann. Says everything about her too.  How did we go so far backwards in a short 4 years? Judi Veiga when old white men were allowed power  Judi Veiga read this: https://www.theatlantic.com/.../collapsing-levels.../616581/ Judi Veiga When did it ever have it?

"""Agents are already worrying about guns and knives and bombs,"" a former Secret Service agent says.

you had me at not requiring students to divulge private personal struggles for a basic extension on a class assignment,"This post is flawed.I now require evidence of death because students were using it as an excuse for not doing any work. In my culture death is an incredibly important thing, and using it as an excuse is degrading to our dead people.Of 6 students who've used death as a reason for not turning in this semester, only one person was being honest. The other five were lying and came clean after I asked. So yes, I will ask for evidence because it's the culturally responsibile thing to do. Genuine question: what kind of inhumane workload are people saddling students with such that they have to make up deaths in the family? I've been at this five years and it hasn't happened once. 김준성 the workload isn't the problem, the lack of flexibility is. We've had to ship assignments to China because the grader's re-entry visa was denied (after visiting family over the holidays), and even then we didn't have this strict of a late work policy. 김준성 in my case a grandma died twice. It’s uni wide policy to provide proof of death since. 김준성 I am just speaking from personal experience. But I KNOW I am not alone in having to deal with this issue. And BTW: I DID have a student kill off the same grandmother two semesters in a row, both times the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. And he ADMITTED it to me. Carol Patterson-Martineau and that’s why documentation is usually required. And I am betting they had pre you’d missing assignments. Just a wild guess!  I write a lot of shit in my syllabus about missing classes and penalties and blah blah, but I also **reward communication** Contact me ahead of an assignment being due with your issue or as soon as possible and we are all good. My whole objective is to give a positive learning experience that will hopefully inspire a life-long love of learning, critical thinking, and *maybe* some knowledge. I seriously doubt any one thing we are teaching them is worth the potential trauma and I'm not going to compromise *my* ethics or punish everyone because of a very small minority of liars and/or cheaters. I had a student tell me that she could not take a final exam because she was in such pain and on meds after having had 8 wisdom teeth removed. I thought I should have questioned her more closely, but recalled how unpleasant it was to have 4 removed. Maybe it felt like 8 or maybe they removed extra molars?  And then Freddie Mercury? I still wonder if she had hyperdontia.  I am a professor, and I don't require documentation for absences unless they become excessive (more than 3).  However my father passed away last February.  My sister is a grad student and one of her professors (doctoral student) required the death certificate.  We weren't able to get it for about 6 weeks later, but by then it was to late to salvage the semester for her. Jessica Slade the death certificate?? What an @ss  I work with a crazy person who asked a student for a copy of the funeral program. Explained that God told her the student was lying and that she should ask for it. There’s deadlines for a reason and college students should be able to meet them.  Patricia J. Safina my grandmother died while I was a junior in college. That half of my family lives in Bogotá. I didn’t go to her funeral because I had professors that shared your opinion, and I didn’t want to demolish my GPA. I still cry about it sometimes, because she was an amazing woman and my best friend. Please, please, please rethink your position. Real life won't forgive being late on deadlines so kindly.  Especially commitments to customers... David J. Jones exactly and we need to train them for that. I’m quite shocked reading these comments.  Uncle died when I was in school and skipped the funeral to study, skipped traveling over Thanksgiving due to 8 finals in 8 days that followed the holiday. Rakesh Gadde im sorry to hear this unfortunate news and the reason why good professors are enforcing rules like this is because of those who lie. Two social problems present here, liars and not enough time off to grieve.  Stephanie Sommer Aya Im not a monster and I’m sorry you had to go through that.  I’m not a monster. I know who is lying to me and who isn’t.  David J. Jones  Real life comes with a variety of challenges and not all bosses are rigid. Yes, deadlines matter, but things do not always go perfect. Expecting perfection from students who might be struggling for a variety of reasons also does not help them.  Patricia J. Safina do you have a blanket ban on deadline extensions? If you do, you are preventing the honest students from grieving, healing, or dealing with whatever life-altering emergency that has come up. Life doesn’t care if you have an exam to study for. Do you care about your students? Real life does allow for lateness, and deadline extensions, and accommodations, because it's being lived by real people going through real challenges! Sure, some bosses and organizations are rigid and heartless - those are the ones you don't even send a resume. I'd rather teach students to expect good in people. Stephanie Sommer Aya I do not. Like I said prior I’m not a monster. I’m strict.  I do not require it and instead choose to trust the student. Awkward: my husband does require it for his students. Keri Mans  I trust students. That’s my default. If I didn’t I wouldn’t be in this job. It’s a shitty enough career without that kind of negativity, and I’m certainly not getting paid enough for it.Have a few probably taken advantage of that? I’m sure they have. But here’s the thing: I don’t care. Listen to C.Tolin Riedel  This. Students learn better when they trust us, and trust is a two-way street. C.Tolin Riedel yes yes yes. This is me. Written word for word.  A drop policy.  No documentation required, students are allowed to miss a certain number of classes/assignments without any penalty.  Covers illnesses and health issues, personal tragedies, etc.  Done and done.   David Lehigh Allen curious how many? Jennifer Mettlen Nolan no right or wrong answer,  it depends on the course.    Some flexibility is needed, too.    I often use a week per semester as  a rule of thumb,  but it can be longer or shorter. We have a centralized process so I no longer have to deal with these requests and all students get consistent treatment. It's great!  When I was an undergrad I took an intro to psychology course where we were told death certificates were required evidence because ""we've had people lose three grandmothers in one year before"". You'd think psychologists would be more aware of the sort o… See More Stephen Whitehead not to mention step-grandparents and gay grandparents are a thing, three or four grandmothers is entirely possible  Stephen Whitehead bottom line—most students lie. I’m not sure it’s a ‘mental toll’ to require documentation after an assignment due, have a history of late assignments, then suddenly claim a death on the family. If that’s so emotionally taxing, then graduating will be nearly impossible. After over a decade of teaching, I’ve found only very few are being honest.  Pamela J. Vincent I'm sorry to hear you're so jaded.The fact of the matter is that having a relative die can be traumatic, and having to go through the process of obtaining a death certificate to submit to your lecturer in addition to that is cruel. Kelly Roth in our case it was the same grandma twice  I lost 2 grandmothers in 2 weeks.  My lecturer did not believe me. I had  to  do  this  when  my  father  died.  It  was  a  huge  headache on  top of  everything,  and  a  very  chillingly  uncaring  req. This happened to me in undergrad, too, after my dad died. Only one prof asked for the obit (the others were much kinder), but it was so traumatizing nonetheless. My daughter asked to be excused from an online Spanish assignment requiring that she identify and name in Spanish colors of various items--or to be allowed to do an alternate assignment. She is color blind. In order to be excused, she would have had to… See More One of my professors did this to a friend whose dad died A WEEK BEFORE GRADUATION. My jaw dropped. The students who have legit death in the family voluntarily and are proactive in submitting their documents. I have caught many cheaters and liars unfortunately.

I had to miss three finals due to a funeral, and having to provide an obituary was awkward and gross but I also kinda get why? Take that shit to the dean or department head.

If you have to require attendance perhaps that says more about you as a professor than it does about the students. Be more interesting. Show me the body! ",

I feel like at this point we all know who we are voting for so all these hostile posts/comments (on both sides) are hurting more than helping the community! I agree people can scroll past but I worry with how the Facebook algorithm works that community members are missing more important local posts like fundraisers, helping neighbors, community events, etc. For example, a long political rant might get more comments so the group doesn’t see posts about a local fundraiser that may have less comments and is more important.  Megan Brothers facebooks algorithm will actually pick up what your friends like or comment on over a new post...more so if you like and comment on those posts....sorry if that response was on another nerd level  Christopher Dominguez I work in digital marketing so no response is a nerd response to me  where does Facebook say that is the case?

"Breaking News: “We need to take away children.” Jeff Sessions and top Justice Department officials pushed hard for migrant family separations in 2018, a watchdog found.","What a fantastic act of ideological larceny, that this party has somehow managed to convince a significant portion of the American public that they are the party of ""morals"" and ""family values"". It truly defies belief. Bryan Fox, Thanks for saying what I'm thinking. To be fair, these are brown children they're discussing, they aren't white kids. Oh, wait, this wouldn't happen to white children, in the trump/Sessions world. Jeffrey Swanson Sher was being sarcastic, saying that Trump's people are only willing to be doing this because the kids are non-white, and that they'd never let it happen to white kids.But, Sher, in reality Trump himself wouldn't care even if they were white because they are in fact poor, and Trump only cares about people who are rich and powerful like him.  EVERYBODY else could literally disappear off the planet and he wouldn't care one iota.  It's apparent in everything he does.  Look at how he treated his Secret Service agents.  He only pretends to care about someone because they're useful tools.  Tools to get elected, tools to help support his position, tools to make him money.  That's it.  Psychologists have pointed this out over and over yet it always seems to get ignored. Bryan Fox Well said. Jeffrey Swanson, I wasn't jesting. Appreciate your feedback. However, they are brown children. They are from different countries, and cultures. These children are precious little people. Would you prefer I say, nonwhite children? I have no idea what you're trying to get at with my calling brown children over white? You seem to get that it's appalling, and you're entitled to be appalled.  Marc Brandenburg, Well said. He's been quoted as saying he's glad COVID happened, as he won't have to shake hands with those disgusting people. Pence' lead task force aide gave us that quote.  Sher Goldesberry ....im not really sure how you meant this comment of yours to be taken...but even in jest your flagrant use of calling children brown over white is appalling... And, yet, the Trumplicans in the House and Senate look the other way. Who ARE these people and why do we need them again in 2020? Bryan Fox Oh my gosh I could not have said it better. Totally agree! It is so bizarre! Bryan Fox. But look how they all falling .  Bryan, that's a Democrat  Sher Goldesberry I find it personally offensive. These children were/are Hispanic. Calling the “brown” children reflects insensitivity Bryan Fox  this is what happens when the conscience is so hardened into depravity. The children will be forever scarred and the parents tragically broken-hearted. Laura Laurel, Hispanic, Latino, Mexican. Calling them Brown children may seem offensive to you, yet it was never meant to be offensive. I used to refer to the kids in cages, as the little Brown children, but that was 3 or 4 years ago.

you had me at not requiring students to divulge private personal struggles for a basic extension on a class assignment,"This post is flawed.I now require evidence of death because students were using it as an excuse for not doing any work. In my culture death is an incredibly important thing, and using it as an excuse is degrading to our dead people.Of 6 students who've used death as a reason for not turning in this semester, only one person was being honest. The other five were lying and came clean after I asked. So yes, I will ask for evidence because it's the culturally responsibile thing to do. Genuine question: what kind of inhumane workload are people saddling students with such that they have to make up deaths in the family? I've been at this five years and it hasn't happened once. 김준성 the workload isn't the problem, the lack of flexibility is. We've had to ship assignments to China because the grader's re-entry visa was denied (after visiting family over the holidays), and even then we didn't have this strict of a late work policy. 김준성 in my case a grandma died twice. It’s uni wide policy to provide proof of death since. 김준성 I am just speaking from personal experience. But I KNOW I am not alone in having to deal with this issue. And BTW: I DID have a student kill off the same grandmother two semesters in a row, both times the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. And he ADMITTED it to me. Carol Patterson-Martineau and that’s why documentation is usually required. And I am betting they had pre you’d missing assignments. Just a wild guess!  I write a lot of shit in my syllabus about missing classes and penalties and blah blah, but I also **reward communication** Contact me ahead of an assignment being due with your issue or as soon as possible and we are all good. My whole objective is to give a positive learning experience that will hopefully inspire a life-long love of learning, critical thinking, and *maybe* some knowledge. I seriously doubt any one thing we are teaching them is worth the potential trauma and I'm not going to compromise *my* ethics or punish everyone because of a very small minority of liars and/or cheaters. I had a student tell me that she could not take a final exam because she was in such pain and on meds after having had 8 wisdom teeth removed. I thought I should have questioned her more closely, but recalled how unpleasant it was to have 4 removed. Maybe it felt like 8 or maybe they removed extra molars?  And then Freddie Mercury? I still wonder if she had hyperdontia.  I am a professor, and I don't require documentation for absences unless they become excessive (more than 3).  However my father passed away last February.  My sister is a grad student and one of her professors (doctoral student) required the death certificate.  We weren't able to get it for about 6 weeks later, but by then it was to late to salvage the semester for her. Jessica Slade the death certificate?? What an @ss  I work with a crazy person who asked a student for a copy of the funeral program. Explained that God told her the student was lying and that she should ask for it. There’s deadlines for a reason and college students should be able to meet them.  Patricia J. Safina my grandmother died while I was a junior in college. That half of my family lives in Bogotá. I didn’t go to her funeral because I had professors that shared your opinion, and I didn’t want to demolish my GPA. I still cry about it sometimes, because she was an amazing woman and my best friend. Please, please, please rethink your position. Real life won't forgive being late on deadlines so kindly.  Especially commitments to customers... David J. Jones exactly and we need to train them for that. I’m quite shocked reading these comments.  Uncle died when I was in school and skipped the funeral to study, skipped traveling over Thanksgiving due to 8 finals in 8 days that followed the holiday. Rakesh Gadde im sorry to hear this unfortunate news and the reason why good professors are enforcing rules like this is because of those who lie. Two social problems present here, liars and not enough time off to grieve.  Stephanie Sommer Aya Im not a monster and I’m sorry you had to go through that.  I’m not a monster. I know who is lying to me and who isn’t.  David J. Jones  Real life comes with a variety of challenges and not all bosses are rigid. Yes, deadlines matter, but things do not always go perfect. Expecting perfection from students who might be struggling for a variety of reasons also does not help them.  Patricia J. Safina do you have a blanket ban on deadline extensions? If you do, you are preventing the honest students from grieving, healing, or dealing with whatever life-altering emergency that has come up. Life doesn’t care if you have an exam to study for. Do you care about your students? Real life does allow for lateness, and deadline extensions, and accommodations, because it's being lived by real people going through real challenges! Sure, some bosses and organizations are rigid and heartless - those are the ones you don't even send a resume. I'd rather teach students to expect good in people. Stephanie Sommer Aya I do not. Like I said prior I’m not a monster. I’m strict.  I do not require it and instead choose to trust the student. Awkward: my husband does require it for his students. Keri Mans  I trust students.

"Serious question I’d like a response to:Can you criticize someone who doesn’t believe in climate change if you believe in God?Person A shows facts, stats, etc to disprove God.… See More","What are the facts that disprove all versions of a higher power?  Elijah Smith no fact disproves all versions of a higher power. A lot of facts cast significant doubt of a higher power. Just like i think no one fact 100% proves climate change is man made, but there are a lot of facts countering the research that exists to significantly cast doubt upon the idea that the climate is changing “naturally” or “in cycle” like it was thousands of years ago. If your argument is there is one fact that proves CC is man made and true vs no one fact that disproves that a higher version doesn’t exist then I would disagree heavily because there is so much scientific literature countering that one fact that proves CC is man made (even if not the best scientific literature.)I guess my arg here is im genuinely trying to wonder why if facts and science is thrown away because logic doesnt shape a belief system on God, I’m having a hard time criticizing those who don’t believe in CC because they are engaging in the same framework - disavowing logic to prove beliefs. I don’t really plan on making any arguments. I just asked a question.I don’t try to convince anyone of anthropogenic warming.Corporations are the issue and they don’t care about god.  I was just wondering where you thought the evidence was similar  If someone's belief system is illogical, then that's the person you're dealing with, but that's not intrinsic to faith in God or faith in data. for example - the historic Christian tradition + scriptures encourages scientific discovery, stewarding the earth (fighting corporate ideology), and truth. bad scientific narratives are just bad theology of a different kind; it's a question of where people are shoring their faith.  Alex Holguin i guess my question is if the intrinsic faith in God does not use logic at all or only relies on faith, can we really criticize those that only use their faith to not believe in CC?  Amit Kukreja I think so - I think it would be hard-pressed to find a faith that doesn't stipulate care for the environment. Making a religious appeal to their call to care superseding their personal desires maybe doesn't let you talk about science/facts, but it does let you get the wrong train on the right track.  Alex Holguin see this makes sense but it also brings up more confusion. because since religion is not objective and is up to interpretation, i can see someone agreeing that helping the environ is important but that their religion also says they have to help their community and if helping their community means polluting the planet (lets say they own an oil drilling company and that provides tons of jobs for the community) then they get to interpret their religion as them doing something good. especially because now im not sure if the religion provides a metric to weigh the environ against helping the community.the only way to get to that answer is to do real, logical, cost benefit analysis. And if we dont use logic but just try to get them on the right train by showing them a verse that says the environment matters, i dont know if that gets us anywhere.  I don't think it's as zero-sum as you're describing it, only insofar as i think it's fairly persuasive for folks to be persuaded to walk and chew gum at the same time. With right reference and examples, I think more religious persons that have some environmental obligation can be persuaded to get on board in some way - the issue is more a pragmatic one than it is one of belief. Like you said, most people can't see past their paycheck - their belief in anything is counter-balanced by their belief in that.  I feel like this conflates metaphysical claims and provable/falsifiable claims. Belief in god is like a philosophical view. It can be based on logic, but it cant be proven true or false via empirical evidence. At the end of the day philosophical claims… See More Perry Beckett hmmm this actually makes sense to me. So basically your saying all philosophical views cant be proven objectively true because they are based on subjective systems of belief even if they use some logic. But CC is not philosophical therefore it is subjective to objective standards.Now my question is if the philosophical beliefs end up being detrimental to society because of its lack of logic (ppl use their religion and do bad things because its their “philosophy”) at what point do we start applying the same rigorous standards of truth testing to those specific philosophical beliefs?    Amit Kukreja Yeah basically, god is an philosophical idea, climate change is a scientific fact. Too answer your second question, I think this is solved by most democracies procedural view of political representation. We agree to follow the state through a social contract, and elect representatives to represent our beliefs. If anti-climate changers lose the election, then they have to listen to the majority on questions of policy.  Why do you feel this is a productive line of inquiry/correlation to make? What’s your stance on whether CC is man made?  Andres Rosero i think CC is man made. Not denying that.this is productive because I’m curious why we tend to throw logic out the window when discussing the existence of God and it only becomes a faith based conversation devoid of science, facts, etc.  This might be hyper reductive of what others like CTimmons and Perry have pointed out, but belief in a “God” or religion or love is not empirically verifiable b/c they are not empirically based questions. Whether the sphere be metaphysical or philosophically subjective, belief in a higher power does not seem to belong to the same plane of thought or logical standards. As was said, different questions require different thought processes/validation.  It’s like the difference in proving “love” and the water cycle.  Cindi Timmons so I agree that love is subjective and almost magical in a sense and probably cant be explained as logically as the water cycle.But there is a decent amount of behavioral psychology and research that gives us an explanation of how to scientifically perceive love, whether its dopamine levels or consistent patterns in human communication or even the nature of love being important to reproduction. I feel like love is super subjective but there is a lot of science to explain the concept of love to someone who may never have been able to understand it.My question is why we dont like to use those standards when approaching the God discussion and only consider it an individual, subjective, faith based discussion.  Cindi Timmons this 100%! For me, it’s like asking for a logical proof as to why a mother loves her child. We can come up with arguments for why it’s true, and how oxytocin plays a role, but the process of trying to rationally explain something like that seems irrational in itself. Something like climate change isn’t that kind of “inner truth”. Disbeliebing in one - I.e. climate change - risks the destruction of the future. Then again, perhaps disbelieving in spirituality as togetherness is just as destructive. Manipulating the nature of either risks a lot of terror though. Matt Casas totally agree. religion is a valuable system of beliefs because without it most people would resort back to their natural evil tendencies.but i also get frustrated when the same people who hate science when it comes to religion love science when it becomes necessary to justify beliefs that fit their political agenda. i feel like if we’re gonna use science as a framework of truth, maybe we shouldnt get rid of it on some of lifes most unique questions.  Yes. Virtues don’t transfer. A person may accept a series of rational argument without accepting a series of rational arguments about God. They will be perceived as “rational” arguments; they may acknowledge the merit of said argument, but will reduce it to a fallacy of some kind.  Chris Williams so basically your arg is peoples’ faith in God is so strong it overdetermines their ability to care about rationality in proving it Amit Kukreja no, I’m saying their faith sets the parameters for what’s considered rational.  Marshall Thompson curious to hear ur thoughts  Amit he always does!!!! Apparently there is a character limit to how much one can post. Sorry about that everyone, my reply will be split between two comments. I've not bothered to go through and edit this, so sorry for whatever writing errors there are!Here is a link to the entire copy (its long enough that some people might like it more accessible form): https://www.dropbox.com/.../Marshall%20Thoughts-Faith%20v... Great question Amit. This is going to be a long post. Those of you who want to understand the view of people who think faith is separate from reason can jump to the bracketed section called [fideism] and those of of you who are just interested in the correct view of faith can skip to where I bracket [faith]. For everyone else, i'm going to include some preliminary discussions to try and provide helpful context. So let's start with this question: Is it hypocritical to say, I believe God exists absent evidence or even despite the best evidence, but I do believe in climate change in light of the evidence?Yes, such a position is usually hypocritical. The rules of evidence don't get to turn on and off just because you are suddenly talking about things that fall into the domain of 'science' or fall into the domain of 'religion'. Orthodox religious belief makes substantive claims about matters of fact. If you say God exists, you are saying much the same sort of thing that you are saying when you say climate change exists. Now, it is true that we don't tend to slot the 'God' question into the domain of science, but that is largely a contingent matter of historical development. For most of intellectual history, theology was considered the 'science of God' in precisely the same way that astronomy was considered the 'science of the heavens'. Now it is true that certain claims are harder or easier to prove or disprove. But this is not a distinction between science and religion, or between objective or subjective, or anything like that. It might be, in principle, impossible to prove that the classical model of relativity is right and the neo-Lorentzian model is wrong. Likewise, it might be unprovable whether the Everett interpretation or a Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is right. But just because it might be impossible to decide those questions by appeal to empirically falsifiable prediction, does not suddenly move them out of the realm of science and into the realm of 'metaphysics' or 'religion' such that it is not permissible for someone to say, I just have faith that the many worlds interpretation is wrong, and so I don't need to have reasons for that, nor respond to your arguments that the many worlds interpretation is more elegant, or simpler etc.Indeed, I think the idea of 'proof' is probably a red-hearing here. I tend to restrict talk of proof to derivations from axioms. I know what it is to prove a geometric proposition with the Euclidean axioms, or what it is to prove a mathematical proposition within the system of peano arithmetic. But what does it mean to prove a scientific theory? Even well established and seemingly true theories in science SOMETIMES get overturned in light of new evidence. We can be more or less certain about scientific theories, just as we can be more or less certain of religious claims, but I think we are just always in a position of needing to respond to the cumulative weight of evidence. [Fideism]Now, there ARE some people who think that the evidential rules of evidence differ for religious propositions. This is known as Fideism, and while it seems to be the dominant implicit understanding of faith among American protestants, it has been an extremely unusual position in the history of Christianity (and the other Abrahamic religions, I don't know enough to speak about religions other than Judaism, Christianity and Islam). Here is one argument loosly inspired by Pascal  for fideism, just to give some idea of what the position is (I think its a rather silly view). Pascal, for instance, famously thought that religious claims were not just difficult or even impossible to prove (remember that might also be true of scientific assertions), but rather had an essential mystery to them which meant even their formulation fell outside the realm of reason. Imagine I want to study a snail. I can study the snail, learn all about it, and the snail will only form the most shadowy conjectures (if that) of what I am like. Nor can the snail do much to resist my understand of it. Suppose though I wanted to get to know a dog. Now it will be a little more equal. The dog could bite me or run away. Its cooperation will definitely help. And the dog will be able to understand me somewhat. But it will mostly be able to understand me if I care for it, and sort of reveal myself to it. If I want to understand you Amit, it will have to be a fairly equitable exchange. You will need to enter into the conversation about as much as I will. You will understand my ideas about as well as I understand yours. That would not be true if I were talking with Einstein. He could understand my thoughts, but I would NOT be able to understand his. Or at least I would not the way he understands them. I would need him to simplify his ideas, give me helpful examples. He would have to bring them down to my level. It's not just that I would not understand his reasons for what he thinks, I would not understand what he thinks at all. So even if I could repeat back exactly what he says when he explains relativity, I would not have a rational belief, because I don't UNDERSTAND what it is that I am purporting to prove. And absent that understanding, the idea of proof does not even yet enter in. Now, the gap between us and God is FAR greater than the gap between us and a snail. Thus there is an essential mystery to God such that God's nature is just not graspable by our reason. Its not that 'God exists' might be impossible to prove or disprove. Pascal thinks even if you could prove something like 'God exists' it would prove something other than God. It would prove something like a first cause, but such a first cause is not God, a first cause is something we can understand. For Pascal, knowledge of God is not propositional knowledge, its acquaintance knowledge. I know you Amit, and I know my Mom. Now part of that consists in knowing lots of facts about both of you, but that is not all. If we spent years together I could tell you everything I know about my mom. But even at the end of that it would not be true for you to day 'I know Jane Thompson'. You would know a lot ABOUT Jane Thompson. But just as I don't know John Adams no matter how many biographies I read, so you can't gain acquaintance knowledge of someone just by provable propositions. So because God is fundamentally mysterious to our reason, its not just that we cannot prove his existence, rather God just eclipse our reason such that there is no positive propositional knowledge of God. The only real positive knowledge of God is knowledge of Acquaintance, and that is just the sort of thing that one does not get by proof or disproof. Even if you convinced me by argument my Mom does not exist and it was all hallucinations, that would not change whether or not I know my mom. It could only change whether I think I know my mom. Now, on this sort of view the Christian could claim that there is a special realm of knowledge by faith that does not extend to climate change. However, this is OBVIOUSLY not what most contemporary American Christians mean when they claim they believe in God as a matter of faith. They still think they are talking about the proposition 'God exists', they just admit they don't have good reasons for it, and are intellectually dishonest and so don't revise their beliefs (which admittedly, is a more respectable intellectual dishonesty than people who manufacture plausible sounding arguments for religion). Now, I'm no Fideist. I think I do have good reasons for believing in God and believing Christianity. I think, on the whole, the most plausible or compelling picture of reality that we have at this point is the Christian picture.  [Faith]But wait, you might now be wondering. If I think the reason one should be a Christian is that the weight of evidence is in favor of Christianity, then what role is left for faith?Now, the reason you have this question is because the concept of faith has been basically ruined in contemporary Christianity (I think it was mostly the Protestant's fault when they ended up wanting to think salvation by faith alone meant salvation by believing a set of doxastic propositions). Originally, faith was taken to mean 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐺𝑜𝑑 now it's taken to mean 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑛 𝐺𝑜𝑑. But those are not at all the same thing. It is easiest to see if we talk about believing someone other than God first. If you say you ate cereal for breakfast then I might believe you. I accept your testimony. I trust that you are a reliable source of information so and accept a conclusion just because you told it to me. That is totally different from an expression 'I believe IN you' (in the sense that people talk about believing IN God). If I were to say I believe IN you in that way, what I would be saying is something like I believe you exist. But the statement, 'I believe you exist' is just a silly one to believe without good reason. In exactly the same way it is silly to believe that there is a perfectly good maximally perfect triune being who created the world and entered into covenantal relationship with humanity without good reason.  Consider the way Elizabeth Anscombe puts it in her wonderful piece ""What is it to Believe Someone"":""At one time, there was the following way of speaking: faith was distinguished as human and divine. Human faith was believing a mere human being; divine faith was believing God. Occurring in discussion without any qualifying adjective, the word “faith” tended to mean only or mostly ‘divine faith’. But its value in this line of descent has quite altered. Nowadays it is used to mean much the same thing as 'religion' or possibly ‘religious belief’. Thus belief in God would now generally be called ‘faith’—belief in God at all, not belief that God will help one, for example. This is a great pity. It has had a disgusting effect on thought about religion. The astounding idea that there should be such a thing as believing God has been lost sight of. “… This has had its effect; for in matters of intellectual fashion we tend to be like sheep. And so, even though the words appear plainly, they are not, it seems, reflected on. Rather, we are deluged with rubbish about ‘believing in' as opposed to ‘believing that’. Like the chorus of animals in Orwell, there is a claque chanting “believing in goo-ood, believing that ba-ad.”...I am not interested here in any sense of ‘believing in ___________’ except that in which it means ‘believing that _________ exists’. This belief, with God as argument, could not be ‘‘divine faith.” This comes out quite clearly if we use my suggested form: believing x that p. It would be bizarre to say that one believed N that N existed.""Now, on this traditional and CORRECT understanding of faith, there is no worrying parallel with climate change. It makes sense to believe God when he tells us things. Or to believe God will save us, protect us, deliver us etc (though those latter things move us into the theological virtue of hope which is the practical corollary of faith). But it does not make sense to believe the non-existence of climate change when it tells us things. The non-existence of climate change is not something one can trust. Now, the thing is. While this correct understanding of faith means we can still go about saying climate change is false. It also means Christians cannot walk around saying 'it does not matter if you have good argument's against God's existence, we are supposed to accept it on faith'. Because faith is not a suitable basis for believing God exists. Rather, once one believes God exists, one is then faced with the question of whether to trust God even when he tells us stuff that seems clearly wrong in light of our own reason. Its a tricky virtue. It's a lot harder to trust God than to trust a friend. My friends are a lot like me. So I can be pretty confident what sort of stuff they might demand of me when I trust them. I can be pretty sure that it will be within the realm of what I regard as reasonable (because I understand how they think). I have no such confidence about God, because God tells us:""For my thoughts are not your thoughts,    neither are your ways my ways,”    declares the Lord.As the heavens are higher than the earth,    so are my ways higher than your ways    and my thoughts than your thoughts.""This makes divine faith a lot scarier and more difficult than human faith. But it also does seem the RATIONAL response to your believe that God is good. Obviously what I say here means I'm in disagreement with what a lot of other people say in responding to your argument. But I imagine at this point it is pretty clear where my disagreements lie, and so won't go through and discuss all the various replies. If there are particular one's you'd like my read on i'm happy to give it though. Marshall Thompson thanks so much Marshall for the indepth analysis. Still reading through it to fully understand it and give it the proper attention it deserves. Will follow up!  so interesting - i learn so much from you! thank you Marshall Thompson for this thoughtful response! Amit Kukreja Nina PotischmanI ended up cannibalizing my response here into an EVEN LONGER post on my blog. Just posting the link here in case anyone is interested: … See More Marshall Thompson reading through it now! have some questions based on this post and the last one but going to read through this one to get a more indepth view on it, im happy my random thought one day inspired so much content from you on this  Marshall Thompson omg i saw theres audio version this is amazing  Yea I add audio to all my blog posts. As a dyslexic philosopher, I have a vested self-interested in trying to get all the other philosophers to create audio recording of all of their work as well!  Okay Marshall so after reading through the blog the main take-a-way i got from it is that all the people on the tread saying God is different from climate change have an incorrect understanding of faith because the nature of scientific inquiry and belief requires evidence. But the correct analysis of faith would be to believe in God, which is not inconsistent with the rational for climate change because one believes to TRUST god from a private, personal perspective, but to believe God exists now begs the question of having to prove it via the same scientific method for climate change which may bring up problems. So believing in God is not contra to climate change being real because it is the correct view of faith, vs. the incorrect view of faith being believing God exists without having to carry the burden of truth for that claim at the same level of climate change because ""they are on different levels."" is that the main argument? If so I think this makes a wholeeeee lotta more sense then the stuff alot of other people were spouting in the comments lol i think this article clarified it really well  Beyond the philosophical stuff, I just personally don't care enough to have a religion debate as said person doesn't use their beliefs to justify violence onto marginalized groups. I do care if someone's a climate denier since that's a belief that actively threatens the planet. If someone uses their religion to justify something terrible (i.e. Christians being homophobic), I'll challenge their stupid Bible verses with the same scrutiny that I challenge climate deniers since that's something I'd find actively bad. But if someone just wants to go to mass I'm not going to argue that since it frankly doesn't matter to me or anyone else. Matthew Chen 100% agree. Mass is cool. Hating gay people not cool.  Yes you can. The difference in that any phenomena has the ability for one side to take on the burden of proof and possibly succeed.  God can’t be proven or disproven, it’s impossible for either side to take on the burden of proof and succeed.   Isaiah Nixon cant God be disproven via logic just like CC can also be proven with logic?  Amit Kukreja God can’t be disproven. God (at least the idea we have of God) exist outside of our observable reality. CC is within our observable reality.   Proving god doesn’t exist is impossible, so faith is justifiable. No one has proven god exists, but no one has proven god doesn’t exist. On the other hand there is international consensus among scientists that CC is real and human made. It’s as close… See More Margaret Strong two qualms with this -1. Im confused when you say impossible. At that point, does it become the same as an opinion?

Over 97% of scientists agree warming is real. As I said before, that’s about as close to perfect proof as you can get.  Damn this is a good question.

Sue Lucero depending on how big the human was and how ambitious the cat was, the guy may have been able to fend off an attack without perishing.  I thought he could have stooped slightly to pick up some rocks and thrown at the cat though.  Easy for me … See More Brad Weinstein Territorial threat display. That's an easy one. Brad Weinstein it is not unusual for lions to leave their cubs unattended for fairly long periods of time, it is why cubs are camouflaged with spots like that ...and scentless. Mama still has to hunt deer and she can't do that with the kids in tow. What seems like a long distance and time for us is not so for them relative to the distances they travel every day Sue Lucero I agree, if results are a measure, he did great. He is safe and so is mama and cubs Matthew Brown I saw all the rocks and wondered (also in the comfort of my home) why he didn’t pick one up. It looks like that might be what he did at the end...? But with that cat advancing on me, I probably wouldn’t want to pause and pick one up either. Going backwards over rocks without tripping would be a feat in itself for me  Matthew Brown, bending down to pick up a rock could make you look smaller and more vulnerable, also you'd have to stop your retreat to do it  Brad Weinstein apologies for my overly dramatic response - was attempting to be funny but clearly failed! I wondered about that myself and these were thoughts in my head trying to figure it out. Serious contemplation at first and then making up ridiculous scenarios  I'm annoyed that ""a local official with Utah's Division of Wildlife Resources, Scott Root, told Burgess: ""You did awesome.'"" He didn't do ""awesome."" He never should have approached the cubs to begin with. He caused the entire encounter, stressing the mamma and cubs. He did not intentionally come upon the cubs, give him a break there. He saw them at a distance and as he was backing off momma showed up. Hey guys, this random person knows more than the wildlife experts! Makenzie Rainer Marsland he filmed himself walking toward the cubs - he intentionally did so https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1315856091821948929 Xen Rod 2 steps too many. And are you being purposefully obtuse? He said there were 4 cubs. Video shows one. Logic would dictate that he saw more before he started filming. And whether he saw the 4, and continued walking, or just stood there, neither option is what he should have done, which was to turn around immediately. A smart person doesn’t mess with wildlife babies. The mother is always nearby.  Danika Hyssong I lived a few blocks from Kyle(the guy in this video) a few years ago. He said when he first saw the cubs, he thought they were bobcats which he has seen in the area before.  Danika Hyssong my husband has been on this trail many times and the way he was walking is the way out. I don’t believe he was trying to get closer to the cubs necessarily.  Go away Danika Hyssong He did awesome, could've ended a lot worse. Danika Hyssong https://www.deseret.com/.../utah-cougar-mountain-lion...

NEW DEBATE Would you rather know how you die or when you die? ,"I was with Amit but after thinking about it. I think I agree with David. Knowing when you die doesn’t mean folks will live their life to the fullest. Especially if the date seems distant. When you’re young, you tend to think about your death as a distant reality. I think the inevitability of our death but the uncertainty of when definitely produces anxiety. But that doesn’t mean that anxiety can’t push us to do things that otherwise we wouldn’t do. The fact that we could die today, tomorrow, a month, two decades can be a major factor for how folks choose to live their lives. Think about all the times you’ve procrastinated on a paper or an assignment. Only to then submit it at 11:59 before the deadline. The knowledge of the deadline makes it so you’re able to squander time. Thinking any day could be your last would have a way of pushing folks to live life to the fullest (which isn’t different from the squo), but I feel like people don’t live life to the fullest precisely because they see death a distant future Carlos Miguel Astacio so if you think the date won’t necessarily make humans live life to the fullest do you think knowing how does anything productive when it comes to death? or are both just not really the best to have full disclosure of Amit Kukreja tbh, the latter. I think knowing how is also pretty rough from a living life to the fullest perspective. Because it takes an already existing source anxiety (the certainty that we will all certainly perish regardless of when or how) and amplifies it by giving you a precise object for one to be anxious about (the whole convo y’all had about avoiding restaurants and air travel).  And if anything. I would add. Knowing the cause of ones death will do nothing to quell the anxiety we experience from our impending/inevitable deaths. You can know you’ll die in a car crash but you’ll never know how it feels to die in a car crash till your ticket gets punched. And once you do, won’t ever live to tell the tale.",
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse used his time during the confirmation hearings to lay out what he called the connections between dark-money groups and the conservative judiciary — while urging Amy Coney Barrett to act against those practices.,"He did such a fantastic job articulating the connections, and making an important case for additional scrutiny and reform.  Katherine Wolcher He proved too much.  His side does the same.   Jeffrey Stuart can you prove your assertion? Jeffrey Stuart so you agree that there needs to be scrutiny and reform? Is so that means we can start with her then.  Jeffrey Stuart, we all know that politics involves MONEY. It's not about whether or not ALL sides are in the money... but what they are doing specifically with that money. Sure... political entities use similar 'vehicles' to execute their agendas, but all of the agendas are NOT the 'same'. People need to LEARN to choose carefully. Both parties may use some of the same 'tools'... but no, they are NOT the same. Jeffrey Stuart You are right. It is a disease in the whole of government. This is the reason someone like Barrett would make the situation even more dangerous. Jeffrey Stuart prove it then, please. Katherine he really did. I wish more people could understand the importance of what he is saying. The way he presented everything was so well said and articulate I'm shocked that people in that very room werent applauding Mark Jacobi Just as well as he proved his assertions.   If you think this is just a problem on the right, bless your heart.   Jeffrey Stuart whitehouse showed his work. Your turn.  Jeffrey Stuart Yeah, no one is blaming Barrett, just the process that brought her to nomination. Where has this guy been all my life???  This was the perfect way to question this candidate and to bring these things to light.  Clearly she is going to be confirmed.  Be like Senator Whitehouse and use your time constructively.  Well done! He’s been great for quite some time now, but I couldn’t agree more about his performance.

"Breaking News: “We need to take away children.” Jeff Sessions and top Justice Department officials pushed hard for migrant family separations in 2018, a watchdog found.","What a fantastic act of ideological larceny, that this party has somehow managed to convince a significant portion of the American public that they are the party of ""morals"" and ""family values"". It truly defies belief. Bryan Fox, Thanks for saying what I'm thinking. To be fair, these are brown children they're discussing, they aren't white kids. Oh, wait, this wouldn't happen to white children, in the trump/Sessions world. Jeffrey Swanson Sher was being sarcastic, saying that Trump's people are only willing to be doing this because the kids are non-white, and that they'd never let it happen to white kids.But, Sher, in reality Trump himself wouldn't care even if they were white because they are in fact poor, and Trump only cares about people who are rich and powerful like him.  EVERYBODY else could literally disappear off the planet and he wouldn't care one iota.  It's apparent in everything he does.  Look at how he treated his Secret Service agents.  He only pretends to care about someone because they're useful tools.  Tools to get elected, tools to help support his position, tools to make him money.  That's it.  Psychologists have pointed this out over and over yet it always seems to get ignored. Bryan Fox Well said. Jeffrey Swanson, I wasn't jesting. Appreciate your feedback. However, they are brown children. They are from different countries, and cultures. These children are precious little people. Would you prefer I say, nonwhite children? I have no idea what you're trying to get at with my calling brown children over white? You seem to get that it's appalling, and you're entitled to be appalled.  Marc Brandenburg, Well said.

Sher Goldesberry ....im not really sure how you meant this comment of yours to be taken...but even in jest your flagrant use of calling children brown over white is appalling... And, yet, the Trumplicans in the House and Senate look the other way. Who ARE these people and why do we need them again in 2020? Bryan Fox Oh my gosh I could not have said it better. Totally agree!

you had me at not requiring students to divulge private personal struggles for a basic extension on a class assignment,"This post is flawed.I now require evidence of death because students were using it as an excuse for not doing any work. In my culture death is an incredibly important thing, and using it as an excuse is degrading to our dead people.Of 6 students who've used death as a reason for not turning in this semester, only one person was being honest. The other five were lying and came clean after I asked. So yes, I will ask for evidence because it's the culturally responsibile thing to do. Genuine question: what kind of inhumane workload are people saddling students with such that they have to make up deaths in the family? I've been at this five years and it hasn't happened once. 김준성 the workload isn't the problem, the lack of flexibility is. We've had to ship assignments to China because the grader's re-entry visa was denied (after visiting family over the holidays), and even then we didn't have this strict of a late work policy. 김준성 in my case a grandma died twice. It’s uni wide policy to provide proof of death since. 김준성 I am just speaking from personal experience. But I KNOW I am not alone in having to deal with this issue. And BTW: I DID have a student kill off the same grandmother two semesters in a row, both times the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. And he ADMITTED it to me. Carol Patterson-Martineau and that’s why documentation is usually required. And I am betting they had pre you’d missing assignments. Just a wild guess!  I write a lot of shit in my syllabus about missing classes and penalties and blah blah, but I also **reward communication** Contact me ahead of an assignment being due with your issue or as soon as possible and we are all good. My whole objective is to give a positive learning experience that will hopefully inspire a life-long love of learning, critical thinking, and *maybe* some knowledge. I seriously doubt any one thing we are teaching them is worth the potential trauma and I'm not going to compromise *my* ethics or punish everyone because of a very small minority of liars and/or cheaters. I had a student tell me that she could not take a final exam because she was in such pain and on meds after having had 8 wisdom teeth removed. I thought I should have questioned her more closely, but recalled how unpleasant it was to have 4 removed. Maybe it felt like 8 or maybe they removed extra molars?  And then Freddie Mercury? I still wonder if she had hyperdontia.  I am a professor, and I don't require documentation for absences unless they become excessive (more than 3).  However my father passed away last February.  My sister is a grad student and one of her professors (doctoral student) required the death certificate.  We weren't able to get it for about 6 weeks later, but by then it was to late to salvage the semester for her. Jessica Slade the death certificate?? What an @ss  I work with a crazy person who asked a student for a copy of the funeral program. Explained that God told her the student was lying and that she should ask for it. There’s deadlines for a reason and college students should be able to meet them.  Patricia J. Safina my grandmother died while I was a junior in college. That half of my family lives in Bogotá. I didn’t go to her funeral because I had professors that shared your opinion, and I didn’t want to demolish my GPA. I still cry about it sometimes, because she was an amazing woman and my best friend. Please, please, please rethink your position. Real life won't forgive being late on deadlines so kindly.  Especially commitments to customers... David J. Jones exactly and we need to train them for that. I’m quite shocked reading these comments.  Uncle died when I was in school and skipped the funeral to study, skipped traveling over Thanksgiving due to 8 finals in 8 days that followed the holiday. Rakesh Gadde im sorry to hear this unfortunate news and the reason why good professors are enforcing rules like this is because of those who lie. Two social problems present here, liars and not enough time off to grieve.  Stephanie Sommer Aya Im not a monster and I’m sorry you had to go through that.  I’m not a monster. I know who is lying to me and who isn’t.  David J. Jones  Real life comes with a variety of challenges and not all bosses are rigid. Yes, deadlines matter, but things do not always go perfect. Expecting perfection from students who might be struggling for a variety of reasons also does not help them.  Patricia J. Safina do you have a blanket ban on deadline extensions? If you do, you are preventing the honest students from grieving, healing, or dealing with whatever life-altering emergency that has come up. Life doesn’t care if you have an exam to study for. Do you care about your students? Real life does allow for lateness, and deadline extensions, and accommodations, because it's being lived by real people going through real challenges! Sure, some bosses and organizations are rigid and heartless - those are the ones you don't even send a resume. I'd rather teach students to expect good in people. Stephanie Sommer Aya I do not. Like I said prior I’m not a monster. I’m strict.  I do not require it and instead choose to trust the student. Awkward: my husband does require it for his students. Keri Mans  I trust students. That’s my default. If I didn’t I wouldn’t be in this job. It’s a shitty enough career without that kind of negativity, and I’m certainly not getting paid enough for it.Have a few probably taken advantage of that? I’m sure they have. But here’s the thing: I don’t care. Listen to C.Tolin Riedel  This. Students learn better when they trust us, and trust is a two-way street. C.Tolin Riedel yes yes yes. This is me. Written word for word.  A drop policy.  No documentation required, students are allowed to miss a certain number of classes/assignments without any penalty.  Covers illnesses and health issues, personal tragedies, etc.  Done and done.   David Lehigh Allen curious how many? Jennifer Mettlen Nolan no right or wrong answer,  it depends on the course.    Some flexibility is needed, too.    I often use a week per semester as  a rule of thumb,  but it can be longer or shorter. We have a centralized process so I no longer have to deal with these requests and all students get consistent treatment. It's great!  When I was an undergrad I took an intro to psychology course where we were told death certificates were required evidence because ""we've had people lose three grandmothers in one year before"". You'd think psychologists would be more aware of the sort o… See More Stephen Whitehead not to mention step-grandparents and gay grandparents are a thing, three or four grandmothers is entirely possible  Stephen Whitehead bottom line—most students lie. I’m not sure it’s a ‘mental toll’ to require documentation after an assignment due, have a history of late assignments, then suddenly claim a death on the family. If that’s so emotionally taxing, then graduating will be nearly impossible. After over a decade of teaching, I’ve found only very few are being honest.  Pamela J. Vincent I'm sorry to hear you're so jaded.The fact of the matter is that having a relative die can be traumatic, and having to go through the process of obtaining a death certificate to submit to your lecturer in addition to that is cruel. Kelly Roth in our case it was the same grandma twice  I lost 2 grandmothers in 2 weeks.  My lecturer did not believe me. I had  to  do  this  when  my  father  died.  It  was  a  huge  headache on  top of  everything,  and  a  very  chillingly  uncaring  req. This happened to me in undergrad, too, after my dad died. Only one prof asked for the obit (the others were much kinder), but it was so traumatizing nonetheless. My daughter asked to be excused from an online Spanish assignment requiring that she identify and name in Spanish colors of various items--or to be allowed to do an alternate assignment. She is color blind. In order to be excused, she would have had to… See More One of my professors did this to a friend whose dad died A WEEK BEFORE GRADUATION. My jaw dropped.

"Serious question I’d like a response to:Can you criticize someone who doesn’t believe in climate change if you believe in God?Person A shows facts, stats, etc to disprove God.… See More","What are the facts that disprove all versions of a higher power?  Elijah Smith no fact disproves all versions of a higher power. A lot of facts cast significant doubt of a higher power. Just like i think no one fact 100% proves climate change is man made, but there are a lot of facts countering the research that exists to significantly cast doubt upon the idea that the climate is changing “naturally” or “in cycle” like it was thousands of years ago. If your argument is there is one fact that proves CC is man made and true vs no one fact that disproves that a higher version doesn’t exist then I would disagree heavily because there is so much scientific literature countering that one fact that proves CC is man made (even if not the best scientific literature.)I guess my arg here is im genuinely trying to wonder why if facts and science is thrown away because logic doesnt shape a belief system on God, I’m having a hard time criticizing those who don’t believe in CC because they are engaging in the same framework - disavowing logic to prove beliefs. I don’t really plan on making any arguments. I just asked a question.I don’t try to convince anyone of anthropogenic warming.Corporations are the issue and they don’t care about god.  I was just wondering where you thought the evidence was similar  If someone's belief system is illogical, then that's the person you're dealing with, but that's not intrinsic to faith in God or faith in data. for example - the historic Christian tradition + scriptures encourages scientific discovery, stewarding the earth (fighting corporate ideology), and truth. bad scientific narratives are just bad theology of a different kind; it's a question of where people are shoring their faith.  Alex Holguin i guess my question is if the intrinsic faith in God does not use logic at all or only relies on faith, can we really criticize those that only use their faith to not believe in CC?  Amit Kukreja I think so - I think it would be hard-pressed to find a faith that doesn't stipulate care for the environment. Making a religious appeal to their call to care superseding their personal desires maybe doesn't let you talk about science/facts, but it does let you get the wrong train on the right track.  Alex Holguin see this makes sense but it also brings up more confusion. because since religion is not objective and is up to interpretation, i can see someone agreeing that helping the environ is important but that their religion also says they have to help their community and if helping their community means polluting the planet (lets say they own an oil drilling company and that provides tons of jobs for the community) then they get to interpret their religion as them doing something good. especially because now im not sure if the religion provides a metric to weigh the environ against helping the community.the only way to get to that answer is to do real, logical, cost benefit analysis. And if we dont use logic but just try to get them on the right train by showing them a verse that says the environment matters, i dont know if that gets us anywhere.  I don't think it's as zero-sum as you're describing it, only insofar as i think it's fairly persuasive for folks to be persuaded to walk and chew gum at the same time. With right reference and examples, I think more religious persons that have some environmental obligation can be persuaded to get on board in some way - the issue is more a pragmatic one than it is one of belief. Like you said, most people can't see past their paycheck - their belief in anything is counter-balanced by their belief in that.  I feel like this conflates metaphysical claims and provable/falsifiable claims. Belief in god is like a philosophical view. It can be based on logic, but it cant be proven true or false via empirical evidence. At the end of the day philosophical claims… See More Perry Beckett hmmm this actually makes sense to me. So basically your saying all philosophical views cant be proven objectively true because they are based on subjective systems of belief even if they use some logic. But CC is not philosophical therefore it is subjective to objective standards.Now my question is if the philosophical beliefs end up being detrimental to society because of its lack of logic (ppl use their religion and do bad things because its their “philosophy”) at what point do we start applying the same rigorous standards of truth testing to those specific philosophical beliefs?    Amit Kukreja Yeah basically, god is an philosophical idea, climate change is a scientific fact. Too answer your second question, I think this is solved by most democracies procedural view of political representation. We agree to follow the state through a social contract, and elect representatives to represent our beliefs. If anti-climate changers lose the election, then they have to listen to the majority on questions of policy.  Why do you feel this is a productive line of inquiry/correlation to make? What’s your stance on whether CC is man made?  Andres Rosero i think CC is man made. Not denying that.this is productive because I’m curious why we tend to throw logic out the window when discussing the existence of God and it only becomes a faith based conversation devoid of science, facts, etc.  This might be hyper reductive of what others like CTimmons and Perry have pointed out, but belief in a “God” or religion or love is not empirically verifiable b/c they are not empirically based questions. Whether the sphere be metaphysical or philosophically subjective, belief in a higher power does not seem to belong to the same plane of thought or logical standards. As was said, different questions require different thought processes/validation.  It’s like the difference in proving “love” and the water cycle.  Cindi Timmons so I agree that love is subjective and almost magical in a sense and probably cant be explained as logically as the water cycle.But there is a decent amount of behavioral psychology and research that gives us an explanation of how to scientifically perceive love, whether its dopamine levels or consistent patterns in human communication or even the nature of love being important to reproduction. I feel like love is super subjective but there is a lot of science to explain the concept of love to someone who may never have been able to understand it.My question is why we dont like to use those standards when approaching the God discussion and only consider it an individual, subjective, faith based discussion.  Cindi Timmons this 100%! For me, it’s like asking for a logical proof as to why a mother loves her child. We can come up with arguments for why it’s true, and how oxytocin plays a role, but the process of trying to rationally explain something like that seems irrational in itself. Something like climate change isn’t that kind of “inner truth”. Disbeliebing in one - I.e. climate change - risks the destruction of the future. Then again, perhaps disbelieving in spirituality as togetherness is just as destructive. Manipulating the nature of either risks a lot of terror though. Matt Casas totally agree. religion is a valuable system of beliefs because without it most people would resort back to their natural evil tendencies.but i also get frustrated when the same people who hate science when it comes to religion love science when it becomes necessary to justify beliefs that fit their political agenda. i feel like if we’re gonna use science as a framework of truth, maybe we shouldnt get rid of it on some of lifes most unique questions.  Yes. Virtues don’t transfer. A person may accept a series of rational argument without accepting a series of rational arguments about God. They will be perceived as “rational” arguments; they may acknowledge the merit of said argument, but will reduce it to a fallacy of some kind.  Chris Williams so basically your arg is peoples’ faith in God is so strong it overdetermines their ability to care about rationality in proving it Amit Kukreja no, I’m saying their faith sets the parameters for what’s considered rational.  Marshall Thompson curious to hear ur thoughts  Amit he always does!!!! Apparently there is a character limit to how much one can post. Sorry about that everyone, my reply will be split between two comments. I've not bothered to go through and edit this, so sorry for whatever writing errors there are!Here is a link to the entire copy (its long enough that some people might like it more accessible form): https://www.dropbox.com/.../Marshall%20Thoughts-Faith%20v... Great question Amit. This is going to be a long post. Those of you who want to understand the view of people who think faith is separate from reason can jump to the bracketed section called [fideism] and those of of you who are just interested in the correct view of faith can skip to where I bracket [faith]. For everyone else, i'm going to include some preliminary discussions to try and provide helpful context. So let's start with this question: Is it hypocritical to say, I believe God exists absent evidence or even despite the best evidence, but I do believe in climate change in light of the evidence?Yes, such a position is usually hypocritical. The rules of evidence don't get to turn on and off just because you are suddenly talking about things that fall into the domain of 'science' or fall into the domain of 'religion'. Orthodox religious belief makes substantive claims about matters of fact. If you say God exists, you are saying much the same sort of thing that you are saying when you say climate change exists. Now, it is true that we don't tend to slot the 'God' question into the domain of science, but that is largely a contingent matter of historical development. For most of intellectual history, theology was considered the 'science of God' in precisely the same way that astronomy was considered the 'science of the heavens'. Now it is true that certain claims are harder or easier to prove or disprove. But this is not a distinction between science and religion, or between objective or subjective, or anything like that. It might be, in principle, impossible to prove that the classical model of relativity is right and the neo-Lorentzian model is wrong. Likewise, it might be unprovable whether the Everett interpretation or a Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is right. But just because it might be impossible to decide those questions by appeal to empirically falsifiable prediction, does not suddenly move them out of the realm of science and into the realm of 'metaphysics' or 'religion' such that it is not permissible for someone to say, I just have faith that the many worlds interpretation is wrong, and so I don't need to have reasons for that, nor respond to your arguments that the many worlds interpretation is more elegant, or simpler etc.Indeed, I think the idea of 'proof' is probably a red-hearing here. I tend to restrict talk of proof to derivations from axioms. I know what it is to prove a geometric proposition with the Euclidean axioms, or what it is to prove a mathematical proposition within the system of peano arithmetic. But what does it mean to prove a scientific theory? Even well established and seemingly true theories in science SOMETIMES get overturned in light of new evidence. We can be more or less certain about scientific theories, just as we can be more or less certain of religious claims, but I think we are just always in a position of needing to respond to the cumulative weight of evidence. [Fideism]Now, there ARE some people who think that the evidential rules of evidence differ for religious propositions. This is known as Fideism, and while it seems to be the dominant implicit understanding of faith among American protestants, it has been an extremely unusual position in the history of Christianity (and the other Abrahamic religions, I don't know enough to speak about religions other than Judaism, Christianity and Islam). Here is one argument loosly inspired by Pascal  for fideism, just to give some idea of what the position is (I think its a rather silly view). Pascal, for instance, famously thought that religious claims were not just difficult or even impossible to prove (remember that might also be true of scientific assertions), but rather had an essential mystery to them which meant even their formulation fell outside the realm of reason. Imagine I want to study a snail. I can study the snail, learn all about it, and the snail will only form the most shadowy conjectures (if that) of what I am like. Nor can the snail do much to resist my understand of it. Suppose though I wanted to get to know a dog. Now it will be a little more equal. The dog could bite me or run away. Its cooperation will definitely help. And the dog will be able to understand me somewhat. But it will mostly be able to understand me if I care for it, and sort of reveal myself to it. If I want to understand you Amit, it will have to be a fairly equitable exchange. You will need to enter into the conversation about as much as I will. You will understand my ideas about as well as I understand yours. That would not be true if I were talking with Einstein. He could understand my thoughts, but I would NOT be able to understand his. Or at least I would not the way he understands them. I would need him to simplify his ideas, give me helpful examples. He would have to bring them down to my level. It's not just that I would not understand his reasons for what he thinks, I would not understand what he thinks at all. So even if I could repeat back exactly what he says when he explains relativity, I would not have a rational belief, because I don't UNDERSTAND what it is that I am purporting to prove. And absent that understanding, the idea of proof does not even yet enter in. Now, the gap between us and God is FAR greater than the gap between us and a snail. Thus there is an essential mystery to God such that God's nature is just not graspable by our reason. Its not that 'God exists' might be impossible to prove or disprove. Pascal thinks even if you could prove something like 'God exists' it would prove something other than God. It would prove something like a first cause, but such a first cause is not God, a first cause is something we can understand. For Pascal, knowledge of God is not propositional knowledge, its acquaintance knowledge. I know you Amit, and I know my Mom. Now part of that consists in knowing lots of facts about both of you, but that is not all. If we spent years together I could tell you everything I know about my mom. But even at the end of that it would not be true for you to day 'I know Jane Thompson'. You would know a lot ABOUT Jane Thompson. But just as I don't know John Adams no matter how many biographies I read, so you can't gain acquaintance knowledge of someone just by provable propositions. So because God is fundamentally mysterious to our reason, its not just that we cannot prove his existence, rather God just eclipse our reason such that there is no positive propositional knowledge of God. The only real positive knowledge of God is knowledge of Acquaintance, and that is just the sort of thing that one does not get by proof or disproof. Even if you convinced me by argument my Mom does not exist and it was all hallucinations, that would not change whether or not I know my mom. It could only change whether I think I know my mom. Now, on this sort of view the Christian could claim that there is a special realm of knowledge by faith that does not extend to climate change. However, this is OBVIOUSLY not what most contemporary American Christians mean when they claim they believe in God as a matter of faith. They still think they are talking about the proposition 'God exists', they just admit they don't have good reasons for it, and are intellectually dishonest and so don't revise their beliefs (which admittedly, is a more respectable intellectual dishonesty than people who manufacture plausible sounding arguments for religion). Now, I'm no Fideist. I think I do have good reasons for believing in God and believing Christianity. I think, on the whole, the most plausible or compelling picture of reality that we have at this point is the Christian picture.  [Faith]But wait, you might now be wondering. If I think the reason one should be a Christian is that the weight of evidence is in favor of Christianity, then what role is left for faith?Now, the reason you have this question is because the concept of faith has been basically ruined in contemporary Christianity (I think it was mostly the Protestant's fault when they ended up wanting to think salvation by faith alone meant salvation by believing a set of doxastic propositions). Originally, faith was taken to mean 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐺𝑜𝑑 now it's taken to mean 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑛 𝐺𝑜𝑑. But those are not at all the same thing. It is easiest to see if we talk about believing someone other than God first. If you say you ate cereal for breakfast then I might believe you. I accept your testimony. I trust that you are a reliable source of information so and accept a conclusion just because you told it to me. That is totally different from an expression 'I believe IN you' (in the sense that people talk about believing IN God). If I were to say I believe IN you in that way, what I would be saying is something like I believe you exist. But the statement, 'I believe you exist' is just a silly one to believe without good reason. In exactly the same way it is silly to believe that there is a perfectly good maximally perfect triune being who created the world and entered into covenantal relationship with humanity without good reason.  Consider the way Elizabeth Anscombe puts it in her wonderful piece ""What is it to Believe Someone"":""At one time, there was the following way of speaking: faith was distinguished as human and divine. Human faith was believing a mere human being; divine faith was believing God. Occurring in discussion without any qualifying adjective, the word “faith” tended to mean only or mostly ‘divine faith’. But its value in this line of descent has quite altered. Nowadays it is used to mean much the same thing as 'religion' or possibly ‘religious belief’. Thus belief in God would now generally be called ‘faith’—belief in God at all, not belief that God will help one, for example. This is a great pity. It has had a disgusting effect on thought about religion. The astounding idea that there should be such a thing as believing God has been lost sight of. “… This has had its effect; for in matters of intellectual fashion we tend to be like sheep. And so, even though the words appear plainly, they are not, it seems, reflected on. Rather, we are deluged with rubbish about ‘believing in' as opposed to ‘believing that’. Like the chorus of animals in Orwell, there is a claque chanting “believing in goo-ood, believing that ba-ad.”...I am not interested here in any sense of ‘believing in ___________’ except that in which it means ‘believing that _________ exists’. This belief, with God as argument, could not be ‘‘divine faith.” This comes out quite clearly if we use my suggested form: believing x that p. It would be bizarre to say that one believed N that N existed.""Now, on this traditional and CORRECT understanding of faith, there is no worrying parallel with climate change. It makes sense to believe God when he tells us things. Or to believe God will save us, protect us, deliver us etc (though those latter things move us into the theological virtue of hope which is the practical corollary of faith). But it does not make sense to believe the non-existence of climate change when it tells us things. The non-existence of climate change is not something one can trust. Now, the thing is. While this correct understanding of faith means we can still go about saying climate change is false. It also means Christians cannot walk around saying 'it does not matter if you have good argument's against God's existence, we are supposed to accept it on faith'. Because faith is not a suitable basis for believing God exists. Rather, once one believes God exists, one is then faced with the question of whether to trust God even when he tells us stuff that seems clearly wrong in light of our own reason. Its a tricky virtue. It's a lot harder to trust God than to trust a friend. My friends are a lot like me. So I can be pretty confident what sort of stuff they might demand of me when I trust them. I can be pretty sure that it will be within the realm of what I regard as reasonable (because I understand how they think). I have no such confidence about God, because God tells us:""For my thoughts are not your thoughts,    neither are your ways my ways,”    declares the Lord.As the heavens are higher than the earth,    so are my ways higher than your ways    and my thoughts than your thoughts.""This makes divine faith a lot scarier and more difficult than human faith. But it also does seem the RATIONAL response to your believe that God is good. Obviously what I say here means I'm in disagreement with what a lot of other people say in responding to your argument. But I imagine at this point it is pretty clear where my disagreements lie, and so won't go through and discuss all the various replies. If there are particular one's you'd like my read on i'm happy to give it though. Marshall Thompson thanks so much Marshall for the indepth analysis. Still reading through it to fully understand it and give it the proper attention it deserves. Will follow up!  so interesting - i learn so much from you! thank you Marshall Thompson for this thoughtful response! Amit Kukreja Nina PotischmanI ended up cannibalizing my response here into an EVEN LONGER post on my blog. Just posting the link here in case anyone is interested: … See More Marshall Thompson reading through it now! have some questions based on this post and the last one but going to read through this one to get a more indepth view on it, im happy my random thought one day inspired so much content from you on this  Marshall Thompson omg i saw theres audio version this is amazing  Yea I add audio to all my blog posts. As a dyslexic philosopher, I have a vested self-interested in trying to get all the other philosophers to create audio recording of all of their work as well!  Okay Marshall so after reading through the blog the main take-a-way i got from it is that all the people on the tread saying God is different from climate change have an incorrect understanding of faith because the nature of scientific inquiry and belief requires evidence. But the correct analysis of faith would be to believe in God, which is not inconsistent with the rational for climate change because one believes to TRUST god from a private, personal perspective, but to believe God exists now begs the question of having to prove it via the same scientific method for climate change which may bring up problems. So believing in God is not contra to climate change being real because it is the correct view of faith, vs. the incorrect view of faith being believing God exists without having to carry the burden of truth for that claim at the same level of climate change because ""they are on different levels."" is that the main argument? If so I think this makes a wholeeeee lotta more sense then the stuff alot of other people were spouting in the comments lol i think this article clarified it really well  Beyond the philosophical stuff, I just personally don't care enough to have a religion debate as said person doesn't use their beliefs to justify violence onto marginalized groups. I do care if someone's a climate denier since that's a belief that actively threatens the planet. If someone uses their religion to justify something terrible (i.e. Christians being homophobic), I'll challenge their stupid Bible verses with the same scrutiny that I challenge climate deniers since that's something I'd find actively bad. But if someone just wants to go to mass I'm not going to argue that since it frankly doesn't matter to me or anyone else. Matthew Chen 100% agree. Mass is cool. Hating gay people not cool.  Yes you can. The difference in that any phenomena has the ability for one side to take on the burden of proof and possibly succeed.  God can’t be proven or disproven, it’s impossible for either side to take on the burden of proof and succeed.   Isaiah Nixon cant God be disproven via logic just like CC can also be proven with logic?  Amit Kukreja God can’t be disproven. God (at least the idea we have of God) exist outside of our observable reality. CC is within our observable reality.   Proving god doesn’t exist is impossible, so faith is justifiable. No one has proven god exists, but no one has proven god doesn’t exist. On the other hand there is international consensus among scientists that CC is real and human made. It’s as close… See More Margaret Strong two qualms with this -1. Im confused when you say impossible. At that point, does it become the same as an opinion?

"""Dude, I don't feel like dying today!"" yelled Kyle Burgess, a twenty-six-year-old who was stalked by a cougar while on a run through Slate Canyon in Provo, Utah.The cougar was protecting her four cubs who were near by.","He handled himself well! Scared but didn’t panic - this is why the video is not his “final moments”! Also, the cougar wasn’t stalking him - if so, he’d be dead. She was protecting her babies. Brad Weinstein If you knew anything about cat behavior, you would recognize the false charge (foot slapping) as a warning.  If she wanted to attack him, he would have been shredded. Brad, she was pushing him out of her territory. Brad Weinstein maybe her BFF was watching them back at the cat lair. Maybe she was trying to decide whether he’d taste good or not. Maybe she was having fun freaking him out. So many possibilities - I’m sorry I’m not 100% sure what her reasoning was.  Sue Lucero depending on how big the human was and how ambitious the cat was, the guy may have been able to fend off an attack without perishing.  I thought he could have stooped slightly to pick up some rocks and thrown at the cat though.  Easy for me … See More Brad Weinstein Territorial threat display. That's an easy one. Brad Weinstein it is not unusual for lions to leave their cubs unattended for fairly long periods of time, it is why cubs are camouflaged with spots like that ...and scentless. Mama still has to hunt deer and she can't do that with the kids in tow. What seems like a long distance and time for us is not so for them relative to the distances they travel every day Sue Lucero I agree, if results are a measure, he did great. He is safe and so is mama and cubs Matthew Brown I saw all the rocks and wondered (also in the comfort of my home) why he didn’t pick one up. It looks like that might be what he did at the end...? But with that cat advancing on me, I probably wouldn’t want to pause and pick one up either. Going backwards over rocks without tripping would be a feat in itself for me  Matthew Brown, bending down to pick up a rock could make you look smaller and more vulnerable, also you'd have to stop your retreat to do it  Brad Weinstein apologies for my overly dramatic response - was attempting to be funny but clearly failed! I wondered about that myself and these were thoughts in my head trying to figure it out. Serious contemplation at first and then making up ridiculous scenarios  I'm annoyed that ""a local official with Utah's Division of Wildlife Resources, Scott Root, told Burgess: ""You did awesome.'"" He didn't do ""awesome."" He never should have approached the cubs to begin with. He caused the entire encounter, stressing the mamma and cubs. He did not intentionally come upon the cubs, give him a break there. He saw them at a distance and as he was backing off momma showed up. Hey guys, this random person knows more than the wildlife experts! Makenzie Rainer Marsland he filmed himself walking toward the cubs - he intentionally did so https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1315856091821948929 Xen Rod 2 steps too many. And are you being purposefully obtuse? He said there were 4 cubs. Video shows one. Logic would dictate that he saw more before he started filming. And whether he saw the 4, and continued walking, or just stood there, neither option is what he should have done, which was to turn around immediately. A smart person doesn’t mess with wildlife babies. The mother is always nearby.  Danika Hyssong I lived a few blocks from Kyle(the guy in this video) a few years ago. He said when he first saw the cubs, he thought they were bobcats which he has seen in the area before.  Danika Hyssong my husband has been on this trail many times and the way he was walking is the way out. I don’t believe he was trying to get closer to the cubs necessarily.

NEW DEBATE Would you rather know how you die or when you die? ,"I was with Amit but after thinking about it. I think I agree with David. Knowing when you die doesn’t mean folks will live their life to the fullest. Especially if the date seems distant. When you’re young, you tend to think about your death as a distant reality. I think the inevitability of our death but the uncertainty of when definitely produces anxiety. But that doesn’t mean that anxiety can’t push us to do things that otherwise we wouldn’t do. The fact that we could die today, tomorrow, a month, two decades can be a major factor for how folks choose to live their lives. Think about all the times you’ve procrastinated on a paper or an assignment. Only to then submit it at 11:59 before the deadline. The knowledge of the deadline makes it so you’re able to squander time. Thinking any day could be your last would have a way of pushing folks to live life to the fullest (which isn’t different from the squo), but I feel like people don’t live life to the fullest precisely because they see death a distant future Carlos Miguel Astacio so if you think the date won’t necessarily make humans live life to the fullest do you think knowing how does anything productive when it comes to death? or are both just not really the best to have full disclosure of Amit Kukreja tbh, the latter. I think knowing how is also pretty rough from a living life to the fullest perspective. Because it takes an already existing source anxiety (the certainty that we will all certainly perish regardless of when or how) and amplifies it by giving you a precise object for one to be anxious about (the whole convo y’all had about avoiding restaurants and air travel).  And if anything. I would add. Knowing the cause of ones death will do nothing to quell the anxiety we experience from our impending/inevitable deaths. You can know you’ll die in a car crash but you’ll never know how it feels to die in a car crash till your ticket gets punched. And once you do, won’t ever live to tell the tale.",
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse used his time during the confirmation hearings to lay out what he called the connections between dark-money groups and the conservative judiciary — while urging Amy Coney Barrett to act against those practices.,"He did such a fantastic job articulating the connections, and making an important case for additional scrutiny and reform.  Katherine Wolcher He proved too much.  His side does the same.   Jeffrey Stuart can you prove your assertion? Jeffrey Stuart so you agree that there needs to be scrutiny and reform? Is so that means we can start with her then.  Jeffrey Stuart, we all know that politics involves MONEY. It's not about whether or not ALL sides are in the money... but what they are doing specifically with that money. Sure... political entities use similar 'vehicles' to execute their agendas, but all of the agendas are NOT the 'same'. People need to LEARN to choose carefully. Both parties may use some of the same 'tools'... but no, they are NOT the same. Jeffrey Stuart You are right. It is a disease in the whole of government. This is the reason someone like Barrett would make the situation even more dangerous. Jeffrey Stuart prove it then, please. Katherine he really did. I wish more people could understand the importance of what he is saying. The way he presented everything was so well said and articulate I'm shocked that people in that very room werent applauding Mark Jacobi Just as well as he proved his assertions.   If you think this is just a problem on the right, bless your heart.   Jeffrey Stuart whitehouse showed his work. Your turn.  Jeffrey Stuart Yeah, no one is blaming Barrett, just the process that brought her to nomination. Where has this guy been all my life???  This was the perfect way to question this candidate and to bring these things to light.  Clearly she is going to be confirmed.  Be like Senator Whitehouse and use your time constructively.  Well done! He’s been great for quite some time now, but I couldn’t agree more about his performance.    Jane Hendrick Seidel if she has an ounce the “integrity” she boasts about, after this presentation, I would like for her to show it by removing herself.

It truly defies belief. Bryan Fox, Thanks for saying what I'm thinking. To be fair, these are brown children they're discussing, they aren't white kids. Oh, wait, this wouldn't happen to white children, in the trump/Sessions world. Jeffrey Swanson Sher was being sarcastic, saying that Trump's people are only willing to be doing this because the kids are non-white, and that they'd never let it happen to white kids.But, Sher, in reality Trump himself wouldn't care even if they were white because they are in fact poor, and Trump only cares about people who are rich and powerful like him.  EVERYBODY else could literally disappear off the planet and he wouldn't care one iota.  It's apparent in everything he does.  Look at how he treated his Secret Service agents.  He only pretends to care about someone because they're useful tools.  Tools to get elected, tools to help support his position, tools to make him money.  That's it.  Psychologists have pointed this out over and over yet it always seems to get ignored. Bryan Fox Well said. Jeffrey Swanson, I wasn't jesting. Appreciate your feedback. However, they are brown children. They are from different countries, and cultures. These children are precious little people. Would you prefer I say, nonwhite children?

you had me at not requiring students to divulge private personal struggles for a basic extension on a class assignment,"This post is flawed.I now require evidence of death because students were using it as an excuse for not doing any work. In my culture death is an incredibly important thing, and using it as an excuse is degrading to our dead people.Of 6 students who've used death as a reason for not turning in this semester, only one person was being honest. The other five were lying and came clean after I asked. So yes, I will ask for evidence because it's the culturally responsibile thing to do. Genuine question: what kind of inhumane workload are people saddling students with such that they have to make up deaths in the family? I've been at this five years and it hasn't happened once. 김준성 the workload isn't the problem, the lack of flexibility is. We've had to ship assignments to China because the grader's re-entry visa was denied (after visiting family over the holidays), and even then we didn't have this strict of a late work policy. 김준성 in my case a grandma died twice. It’s uni wide policy to provide proof of death since. 김준성 I am just speaking from personal experience. But I KNOW I am not alone in having to deal with this issue. And BTW: I DID have a student kill off the same grandmother two semesters in a row, both times the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. And he ADMITTED it to me. Carol Patterson-Martineau and that’s why documentation is usually required. And I am betting they had pre you’d missing assignments. Just a wild guess!  I write a lot of shit in my syllabus about missing classes and penalties and blah blah, but I also **reward communication** Contact me ahead of an assignment being due with your issue or as soon as possible and we are all good. My whole objective is to give a positive learning experience that will hopefully inspire a life-long love of learning, critical thinking, and *maybe* some knowledge. I seriously doubt any one thing we are teaching them is worth the potential trauma and I'm not going to compromise *my* ethics or punish everyone because of a very small minority of liars and/or cheaters. I had a student tell me that she could not take a final exam because she was in such pain and on meds after having had 8 wisdom teeth removed. I thought I should have questioned her more closely, but recalled how unpleasant it was to have 4 removed. Maybe it felt like 8 or maybe they removed extra molars?  And then Freddie Mercury? I still wonder if she had hyperdontia.  I am a professor, and I don't require documentation for absences unless they become excessive (more than 3).  However my father passed away last February.  My sister is a grad student and one of her professors (doctoral student) required the death certificate.  We weren't able to get it for about 6 weeks later, but by then it was to late to salvage the semester for her. Jessica Slade the death certificate?? What an @ss  I work with a crazy person who asked a student for a copy of the funeral program. Explained that God told her the student was lying and that she should ask for it. There’s deadlines for a reason and college students should be able to meet them.  Patricia J. Safina my grandmother died while I was a junior in college. That half of my family lives in Bogotá. I didn’t go to her funeral because I had professors that shared your opinion, and I didn’t want to demolish my GPA. I still cry about it sometimes, because she was an amazing woman and my best friend. Please, please, please rethink your position. Real life won't forgive being late on deadlines so kindly.  Especially commitments to customers... David J. Jones exactly and we need to train them for that. I’m quite shocked reading these comments.  Uncle died when I was in school and skipped the funeral to study, skipped traveling over Thanksgiving due to 8 finals in 8 days that followed the holiday. Rakesh Gadde im sorry to hear this unfortunate news and the reason why good professors are enforcing rules like this is because of those who lie. Two social problems present here, liars and not enough time off to grieve.  Stephanie Sommer Aya Im not a monster and I’m sorry you had to go through that.  I’m not a monster. I know who is lying to me and who isn’t.  David J. Jones  Real life comes with a variety of challenges and not all bosses are rigid. Yes, deadlines matter, but things do not always go perfect. Expecting perfection from students who might be struggling for a variety of reasons also does not help them.  Patricia J. Safina do you have a blanket ban on deadline extensions? If you do, you are preventing the honest students from grieving, healing, or dealing with whatever life-altering emergency that has come up. Life doesn’t care if you have an exam to study for. Do you care about your students? Real life does allow for lateness, and deadline extensions, and accommodations, because it's being lived by real people going through real challenges! Sure, some bosses and organizations are rigid and heartless - those are the ones you don't even send a resume. I'd rather teach students to expect good in people. Stephanie Sommer Aya I do not. Like I said prior I’m not a monster. I’m strict.  I do not require it and instead choose to trust the student. Awkward: my husband does require it for his students. Keri Mans  I trust students. That’s my default. If I didn’t I wouldn’t be in this job. It’s a shitty enough career without that kind of negativity, and I’m certainly not getting paid enough for it.Have a few probably taken advantage of that? I’m sure they have. But here’s the thing: I don’t care. Listen to C.Tolin Riedel  This. Students learn better when they trust us, and trust is a two-way street. C.Tolin Riedel yes yes yes. This is me. Written word for word.  A drop policy.  No documentation required, students are allowed to miss a certain number of classes/assignments without any penalty.  Covers illnesses and health issues, personal tragedies, etc.  Done and done.   David Lehigh Allen curious how many? Jennifer Mettlen Nolan no right or wrong answer,  it depends on the course.    Some flexibility is needed, too.    I often use a week per semester as  a rule of thumb,  but it can be longer or shorter. We have a centralized process so I no longer have to deal with these requests and all students get consistent treatment. It's great!  When I was an undergrad I took an intro to psychology course where we were told death certificates were required evidence because ""we've had people lose three grandmothers in one year before"". You'd think psychologists would be more aware of the sort o… See More Stephen Whitehead not to mention step-grandparents and gay grandparents are a thing, three or four grandmothers is entirely possible  Stephen Whitehead bottom line—most students lie. I’m not sure it’s a ‘mental toll’ to require documentation after an assignment due, have a history of late assignments, then suddenly claim a death on the family. If that’s so emotionally taxing, then graduating will be nearly impossible. After over a decade of teaching, I’ve found only very few are being honest.  Pamela J. Vincent I'm sorry to hear you're so jaded.The fact of the matter is that having a relative die can be traumatic, and having to go through the process of obtaining a death certificate to submit to your lecturer in addition to that is cruel. Kelly Roth in our case it was the same grandma twice  I lost 2 grandmothers in 2 weeks.  My lecturer did not believe me. I had  to  do  this  when  my  father  died.  It  was  a  huge  headache on  top of  everything,  and  a  very  chillingly  uncaring  req. This happened to me in undergrad, too, after my dad died. Only one prof asked for the obit (the others were much kinder), but it was so traumatizing nonetheless. My daughter asked to be excused from an online Spanish assignment requiring that she identify and name in Spanish colors of various items--or to be allowed to do an alternate assignment. She is color blind. In order to be excused, she would have had to… See More One of my professors did this to a friend whose dad died A WEEK BEFORE GRADUATION. My jaw dropped.

Seems easiest to just not allow versus deal with all the junk that comes with them  Megan Brothers that is a legitimate argument....but politics whether at the state or national level is something that effects this community and feel that this is an appropriate forum to discuss it as it effects all of us. There are several other group… See More Christopher Dominguez thanks for replying! I feel like at this point we all know who we are voting for so all these hostile posts/comments (on both sides) are hurting more than helping the community! I agree people can scroll past but I worry with how the Facebook algorithm works that community members are missing more important local posts like fundraisers, helping neighbors, community events, etc. For example, a long political rant might get more comments so the group doesn’t see posts about a local fundraiser that may have less comments and is more important.  Megan Brothers facebooks algorithm will actually pick up what your friends like or comment on over a new post...more so if you like and comment on those posts....sorry if that response was on another nerd level  Christopher Dominguez I work in digital marketing so no response is a nerd response to me  where does Facebook say that is the case? I don’t agree and have learned differently so legit curious, not trying to argue! Haha  Christopher Dominguez also what I’m saying is that if a post has more engagement (No one is my friend), the post with engagement will show more likely than the post with none  Megan Brothers overall interaction does play a roll, however my understanding was that your and your friends interaction do get prioritized over that (I think) but that being said, that overall interaction could offer as an argument to allow those post… See More Christopher Dominguez totally and you will never make everyone happy. I guess at this point no one is changing their mind so I think a lot of people would rather learn about local fundraisers and community events then reading people’a extremely biased posts. It’s a bummer that someone will miss the chance to donate to the local children’s groups, help find a lost dog or help a family in need because we are reading posts of adults arguing like children  Megan Brothers those posts are typically cross posted and show up (in my feed) double.. sometimes triple fold. In addition to that, I'm confident the admins in this group participate in said fund raisers and events more than any other group and do more… See More Christopher Dominguez I’m not questioning the admins involvement in the community, never said that. Not a competition between local Facebook group mods. I’m talking about the average person missing it. The average person might not be friends with the same people as you (because you guys are so involved with the community) and like you said, posts with your friends engagements show up more often, maybe 3 times. I’m just trying to offer you a different perspective from what the admins see but you guys can do whatever you want.

"Serious question I’d like a response to:Can you criticize someone who doesn’t believe in climate change if you believe in God?Person A shows facts, stats, etc to disprove God.… See More","What are the facts that disprove all versions of a higher power?  Elijah Smith no fact disproves all versions of a higher power. A lot of facts cast significant doubt of a higher power. Just like i think no one fact 100% proves climate change is man made, but there are a lot of facts countering the research that exists to significantly cast doubt upon the idea that the climate is changing “naturally” or “in cycle” like it was thousands of years ago. If your argument is there is one fact that proves CC is man made and true vs no one fact that disproves that a higher version doesn’t exist then I would disagree heavily because there is so much scientific literature countering that one fact that proves CC is man made (even if not the best scientific literature.)I guess my arg here is im genuinely trying to wonder why if facts and science is thrown away because logic doesnt shape a belief system on God, I’m having a hard time criticizing those who don’t believe in CC because they are engaging in the same framework - disavowing logic to prove beliefs. I don’t really plan on making any arguments. I just asked a question.I don’t try to convince anyone of anthropogenic warming.Corporations are the issue and they don’t care about god.  I was just wondering where you thought the evidence was similar  If someone's belief system is illogical, then that's the person you're dealing with, but that's not intrinsic to faith in God or faith in data. for example - the historic Christian tradition + scriptures encourages scientific discovery, stewarding the earth (fighting corporate ideology), and truth. bad scientific narratives are just bad theology of a different kind; it's a question of where people are shoring their faith.  Alex Holguin i guess my question is if the intrinsic faith in God does not use logic at all or only relies on faith, can we really criticize those that only use their faith to not believe in CC?  Amit Kukreja I think so - I think it would be hard-pressed to find a faith that doesn't stipulate care for the environment. Making a religious appeal to their call to care superseding their personal desires maybe doesn't let you talk about science/facts, but it does let you get the wrong train on the right track.  Alex Holguin see this makes sense but it also brings up more confusion. because since religion is not objective and is up to interpretation, i can see someone agreeing that helping the environ is important but that their religion also says they have to help their community and if helping their community means polluting the planet (lets say they own an oil drilling company and that provides tons of jobs for the community) then they get to interpret their religion as them doing something good. especially because now im not sure if the religion provides a metric to weigh the environ against helping the community.the only way to get to that answer is to do real, logical, cost benefit analysis. And if we dont use logic but just try to get them on the right train by showing them a verse that says the environment matters, i dont know if that gets us anywhere.  I don't think it's as zero-sum as you're describing it, only insofar as i think it's fairly persuasive for folks to be persuaded to walk and chew gum at the same time. With right reference and examples, I think more religious persons that have some environmental obligation can be persuaded to get on board in some way - the issue is more a pragmatic one than it is one of belief. Like you said, most people can't see past their paycheck - their belief in anything is counter-balanced by their belief in that.  I feel like this conflates metaphysical claims and provable/falsifiable claims. Belief in god is like a philosophical view. It can be based on logic, but it cant be proven true or false via empirical evidence. At the end of the day philosophical claims… See More Perry Beckett hmmm this actually makes sense to me. So basically your saying all philosophical views cant be proven objectively true because they are based on subjective systems of belief even if they use some logic. But CC is not philosophical therefore it is subjective to objective standards.Now my question is if the philosophical beliefs end up being detrimental to society because of its lack of logic (ppl use their religion and do bad things because its their “philosophy”) at what point do we start applying the same rigorous standards of truth testing to those specific philosophical beliefs?    Amit Kukreja Yeah basically, god is an philosophical idea, climate change is a scientific fact. Too answer your second question, I think this is solved by most democracies procedural view of political representation. We agree to follow the state through a social contract, and elect representatives to represent our beliefs. If anti-climate changers lose the election, then they have to listen to the majority on questions of policy.  Why do you feel this is a productive line of inquiry/correlation to make? What’s your stance on whether CC is man made?  Andres Rosero i think CC is man made. Not denying that.this is productive because I’m curious why we tend to throw logic out the window when discussing the existence of God and it only becomes a faith based conversation devoid of science, facts, etc.  This might be hyper reductive of what others like CTimmons and Perry have pointed out, but belief in a “God” or religion or love is not empirically verifiable b/c they are not empirically based questions. Whether the sphere be metaphysical or philosophically subjective, belief in a higher power does not seem to belong to the same plane of thought or logical standards. As was said, different questions require different thought processes/validation.  It’s like the difference in proving “love” and the water cycle.  Cindi Timmons so I agree that love is subjective and almost magical in a sense and probably cant be explained as logically as the water cycle.But there is a decent amount of behavioral psychology and research that gives us an explanation of how to scientifically perceive love, whether its dopamine levels or consistent patterns in human communication or even the nature of love being important to reproduction. I feel like love is super subjective but there is a lot of science to explain the concept of love to someone who may never have been able to understand it.My question is why we dont like to use those standards when approaching the God discussion and only consider it an individual, subjective, faith based discussion.  Cindi Timmons this 100%! For me, it’s like asking for a logical proof as to why a mother loves her child. We can come up with arguments for why it’s true, and how oxytocin plays a role, but the process of trying to rationally explain something like that seems irrational in itself. Something like climate change isn’t that kind of “inner truth”. Disbeliebing in one - I.e. climate change - risks the destruction of the future. Then again, perhaps disbelieving in spirituality as togetherness is just as destructive. Manipulating the nature of either risks a lot of terror though. Matt Casas totally agree. religion is a valuable system of beliefs because without it most people would resort back to their natural evil tendencies.but i also get frustrated when the same people who hate science when it comes to religion love science when it becomes necessary to justify beliefs that fit their political agenda. i feel like if we’re gonna use science as a framework of truth, maybe we shouldnt get rid of it on some of lifes most unique questions.  Yes. Virtues don’t transfer. A person may accept a series of rational argument without accepting a series of rational arguments about God. They will be perceived as “rational” arguments; they may acknowledge the merit of said argument, but will reduce it to a fallacy of some kind.  Chris Williams so basically your arg is peoples’ faith in God is so strong it overdetermines their ability to care about rationality in proving it Amit Kukreja no, I’m saying their faith sets the parameters for what’s considered rational.  Marshall Thompson curious to hear ur thoughts  Amit he always does!!!! Apparently there is a character limit to how much one can post. Sorry about that everyone, my reply will be split between two comments. I've not bothered to go through and edit this, so sorry for whatever writing errors there are!Here is a link to the entire copy (its long enough that some people might like it more accessible form): https://www.dropbox.com/.../Marshall%20Thoughts-Faith%20v... Great question Amit. This is going to be a long post. Those of you who want to understand the view of people who think faith is separate from reason can jump to the bracketed section called [fideism] and those of of you who are just interested in the correct view of faith can skip to where I bracket [faith]. For everyone else, i'm going to include some preliminary discussions to try and provide helpful context. So let's start with this question: Is it hypocritical to say, I believe God exists absent evidence or even despite the best evidence, but I do believe in climate change in light of the evidence?Yes, such a position is usually hypocritical. The rules of evidence don't get to turn on and off just because you are suddenly talking about things that fall into the domain of 'science' or fall into the domain of 'religion'. Orthodox religious belief makes substantive claims about matters of fact. If you say God exists, you are saying much the same sort of thing that you are saying when you say climate change exists. Now, it is true that we don't tend to slot the 'God' question into the domain of science, but that is largely a contingent matter of historical development. For most of intellectual history, theology was considered the 'science of God' in precisely the same way that astronomy was considered the 'science of the heavens'. Now it is true that certain claims are harder or easier to prove or disprove. But this is not a distinction between science and religion, or between objective or subjective, or anything like that. It might be, in principle, impossible to prove that the classical model of relativity is right and the neo-Lorentzian model is wrong. Likewise, it might be unprovable whether the Everett interpretation or a Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is right. But just because it might be impossible to decide those questions by appeal to empirically falsifiable prediction, does not suddenly move them out of the realm of science and into the realm of 'metaphysics' or 'religion' such that it is not permissible for someone to say, I just have faith that the many worlds interpretation is wrong, and so I don't need to have reasons for that, nor respond to your arguments that the many worlds interpretation is more elegant, or simpler etc.Indeed, I think the idea of 'proof' is probably a red-hearing here. I tend to restrict talk of proof to derivations from axioms. I know what it is to prove a geometric proposition with the Euclidean axioms, or what it is to prove a mathematical proposition within the system of peano arithmetic. But what does it mean to prove a scientific theory? Even well established and seemingly true theories in science SOMETIMES get overturned in light of new evidence. We can be more or less certain about scientific theories, just as we can be more or less certain of religious claims, but I think we are just always in a position of needing to respond to the cumulative weight of evidence. [Fideism]Now, there ARE some people who think that the evidential rules of evidence differ for religious propositions. This is known as Fideism, and while it seems to be the dominant implicit understanding of faith among American protestants, it has been an extremely unusual position in the history of Christianity (and the other Abrahamic religions, I don't know enough to speak about religions other than Judaism, Christianity and Islam). Here is one argument loosly inspired by Pascal  for fideism, just to give some idea of what the position is (I think its a rather silly view). Pascal, for instance, famously thought that religious claims were not just difficult or even impossible to prove (remember that might also be true of scientific assertions), but rather had an essential mystery to them which meant even their formulation fell outside the realm of reason. Imagine I want to study a snail. I can study the snail, learn all about it, and the snail will only form the most shadowy conjectures (if that) of what I am like. Nor can the snail do much to resist my understand of it. Suppose though I wanted to get to know a dog. Now it will be a little more equal. The dog could bite me or run away. Its cooperation will definitely help. And the dog will be able to understand me somewhat. But it will mostly be able to understand me if I care for it, and sort of reveal myself to it. If I want to understand you Amit, it will have to be a fairly equitable exchange. You will need to enter into the conversation about as much as I will. You will understand my ideas about as well as I understand yours. That would not be true if I were talking with Einstein. He could understand my thoughts, but I would NOT be able to understand his. Or at least I would not the way he understands them. I would need him to simplify his ideas, give me helpful examples. He would have to bring them down to my level. It's not just that I would not understand his reasons for what he thinks, I would not understand what he thinks at all. So even if I could repeat back exactly what he says when he explains relativity, I would not have a rational belief, because I don't UNDERSTAND what it is that I am purporting to prove. And absent that understanding, the idea of proof does not even yet enter in. Now, the gap between us and God is FAR greater than the gap between us and a snail. Thus there is an essential mystery to God such that God's nature is just not graspable by our reason. Its not that 'God exists' might be impossible to prove or disprove. Pascal thinks even if you could prove something like 'God exists' it would prove something other than God. It would prove something like a first cause, but such a first cause is not God, a first cause is something we can understand. For Pascal, knowledge of God is not propositional knowledge, its acquaintance knowledge. I know you Amit, and I know my Mom. Now part of that consists in knowing lots of facts about both of you, but that is not all. If we spent years together I could tell you everything I know about my mom. But even at the end of that it would not be true for you to day 'I know Jane Thompson'. You would know a lot ABOUT Jane Thompson. But just as I don't know John Adams no matter how many biographies I read, so you can't gain acquaintance knowledge of someone just by provable propositions. So because God is fundamentally mysterious to our reason, its not just that we cannot prove his existence, rather God just eclipse our reason such that there is no positive propositional knowledge of God. The only real positive knowledge of God is knowledge of Acquaintance, and that is just the sort of thing that one does not get by proof or disproof. Even if you convinced me by argument my Mom does not exist and it was all hallucinations, that would not change whether or not I know my mom. It could only change whether I think I know my mom. Now, on this sort of view the Christian could claim that there is a special realm of knowledge by faith that does not extend to climate change. However, this is OBVIOUSLY not what most contemporary American Christians mean when they claim they believe in God as a matter of faith. They still think they are talking about the proposition 'God exists', they just admit they don't have good reasons for it, and are intellectually dishonest and so don't revise their beliefs (which admittedly, is a more respectable intellectual dishonesty than people who manufacture plausible sounding arguments for religion). Now, I'm no Fideist. I think I do have good reasons for believing in God and believing Christianity. I think, on the whole, the most plausible or compelling picture of reality that we have at this point is the Christian picture.  [Faith]But wait, you might now be wondering. If I think the reason one should be a Christian is that the weight of evidence is in favor of Christianity, then what role is left for faith?Now, the reason you have this question is because the concept of faith has been basically ruined in contemporary Christianity (I think it was mostly the Protestant's fault when they ended up wanting to think salvation by faith alone meant salvation by believing a set of doxastic propositions). Originally, faith was taken to mean 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐺𝑜𝑑 now it's taken to mean 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑛 𝐺𝑜𝑑. But those are not at all the same thing. It is easiest to see if we talk about believing someone other than God first. If you say you ate cereal for breakfast then I might believe you. I accept your testimony. I trust that you are a reliable source of information so and accept a conclusion just because you told it to me. That is totally different from an expression 'I believe IN you' (in the sense that people talk about believing IN God). If I were to say I believe IN you in that way, what I would be saying is something like I believe you exist. But the statement, 'I believe you exist' is just a silly one to believe without good reason. In exactly the same way it is silly to believe that there is a perfectly good maximally perfect triune being who created the world and entered into covenantal relationship with humanity without good reason.  Consider the way Elizabeth Anscombe puts it in her wonderful piece ""What is it to Believe Someone"":""At one time, there was the following way of speaking: faith was distinguished as human and divine. Human faith was believing a mere human being; divine faith was believing God. Occurring in discussion without any qualifying adjective, the word “faith” tended to mean only or mostly ‘divine faith’. But its value in this line of descent has quite altered. Nowadays it is used to mean much the same thing as 'religion' or possibly ‘religious belief’. Thus belief in God would now generally be called ‘faith’—belief in God at all, not belief that God will help one, for example. This is a great pity. It has had a disgusting effect on thought about religion. The astounding idea that there should be such a thing as believing God has been lost sight of. “… This has had its effect; for in matters of intellectual fashion we tend to be like sheep. And so, even though the words appear plainly, they are not, it seems, reflected on. Rather, we are deluged with rubbish about ‘believing in' as opposed to ‘believing that’. Like the chorus of animals in Orwell, there is a claque chanting “believing in goo-ood, believing that ba-ad.”...I am not interested here in any sense of ‘believing in ___________’ except that in which it means ‘believing that _________ exists’. This belief, with God as argument, could not be ‘‘divine faith.” This comes out quite clearly if we use my suggested form: believing x that p. It would be bizarre to say that one believed N that N existed.""Now, on this traditional and CORRECT understanding of faith, there is no worrying parallel with climate change. It makes sense to believe God when he tells us things. Or to believe God will save us, protect us, deliver us etc (though those latter things move us into the theological virtue of hope which is the practical corollary of faith). But it does not make sense to believe the non-existence of climate change when it tells us things. The non-existence of climate change is not something one can trust. Now, the thing is. While this correct understanding of faith means we can still go about saying climate change is false. It also means Christians cannot walk around saying 'it does not matter if you have good argument's against God's existence, we are supposed to accept it on faith'. Because faith is not a suitable basis for believing God exists. Rather, once one believes God exists, one is then faced with the question of whether to trust God even when he tells us stuff that seems clearly wrong in light of our own reason. Its a tricky virtue. It's a lot harder to trust God than to trust a friend. My friends are a lot like me. So I can be pretty confident what sort of stuff they might demand of me when I trust them. I can be pretty sure that it will be within the realm of what I regard as reasonable (because I understand how they think). I have no such confidence about God, because God tells us:""For my thoughts are not your thoughts,    neither are your ways my ways,”    declares the Lord.As the heavens are higher than the earth,    so are my ways higher than your ways    and my thoughts than your thoughts.""This makes divine faith a lot scarier and more difficult than human faith. But it also does seem the RATIONAL response to your believe that God is good. Obviously what I say here means I'm in disagreement with what a lot of other people say in responding to your argument. But I imagine at this point it is pretty clear where my disagreements lie, and so won't go through and discuss all the various replies. If there are particular one's you'd like my read on i'm happy to give it though. Marshall Thompson thanks so much Marshall for the indepth analysis. Still reading through it to fully understand it and give it the proper attention it deserves. Will follow up!  so interesting - i learn so much from you! thank you Marshall Thompson for this thoughtful response! Amit Kukreja Nina PotischmanI ended up cannibalizing my response here into an EVEN LONGER post on my blog. Just posting the link here in case anyone is interested: … See More Marshall Thompson reading through it now! have some questions based on this post and the last one but going to read through this one to get a more indepth view on it, im happy my random thought one day inspired so much content from you on this  Marshall Thompson omg i saw theres audio version this is amazing  Yea I add audio to all my blog posts. As a dyslexic philosopher, I have a vested self-interested in trying to get all the other philosophers to create audio recording of all of their work as well!  Okay Marshall so after reading through the blog the main take-a-way i got from it is that all the people on the tread saying God is different from climate change have an incorrect understanding of faith because the nature of scientific inquiry and belief requires evidence. But the correct analysis of faith would be to believe in God, which is not inconsistent with the rational for climate change because one believes to TRUST god from a private, personal perspective, but to believe God exists now begs the question of having to prove it via the same scientific method for climate change which may bring up problems. So believing in God is not contra to climate change being real because it is the correct view of faith, vs. the incorrect view of faith being believing God exists without having to carry the burden of truth for that claim at the same level of climate change because ""they are on different levels."" is that the main argument? If so I think this makes a wholeeeee lotta more sense then the stuff alot of other people were spouting in the comments lol i think this article clarified it really well  Beyond the philosophical stuff, I just personally don't care enough to have a religion debate as said person doesn't use their beliefs to justify violence onto marginalized groups. I do care if someone's a climate denier since that's a belief that actively threatens the planet. If someone uses their religion to justify something terrible (i.e. Christians being homophobic), I'll challenge their stupid Bible verses with the same scrutiny that I challenge climate deniers since that's something I'd find actively bad. But if someone just wants to go to mass I'm not going to argue that since it frankly doesn't matter to me or anyone else. Matthew Chen 100% agree. Mass is cool. Hating gay people not cool.  Yes you can. The difference in that any phenomena has the ability for one side to take on the burden of proof and possibly succeed.  God can’t be proven or disproven, it’s impossible for either side to take on the burden of proof and succeed.   Isaiah Nixon cant God be disproven via logic just like CC can also be proven with logic?  Amit Kukreja God can’t be disproven. God (at least the idea we have of God) exist outside of our observable reality. CC is within our observable reality.   Proving god doesn’t exist is impossible, so faith is justifiable. No one has proven god exists, but no one has proven god doesn’t exist. On the other hand there is international consensus among scientists that CC is real and human made. It’s as close… See More Margaret Strong two qualms with this -1. Im confused when you say impossible. At that point, does it become the same as an opinion?

Over 97% of scientists agree warming is real. As I said before, that’s about as close to perfect proof as you can get.  Damn this is a good question.

Maybe she was having fun freaking him out. So many possibilities - I’m sorry I’m not 100% sure what her reasoning was.  Sue Lucero depending on how big the human was and how ambitious the cat was, the guy may have been able to fend off an attack without perishing.  I thought he could have stooped slightly to pick up some rocks and thrown at the cat though.  Easy for me … See More Brad Weinstein Territorial threat display. That's an easy one. Brad Weinstein it is not unusual for lions to leave their cubs unattended for fairly long periods of time, it is why cubs are camouflaged with spots like that ...and scentless. Mama still has to hunt deer and she can't do that with the kids in tow. What seems like a long distance and time for us is not so for them relative to the distances they travel every day Sue Lucero I agree, if results are a measure, he did great. He is safe and so is mama and cubs Matthew Brown I saw all the rocks and wondered (also in the comfort of my home) why he didn’t pick one up. It looks like that might be what he did at the end...? But with that cat advancing on me, I probably wouldn’t want to pause and pick one up either. Going backwards over rocks without tripping would be a feat in itself for me  Matthew Brown, bending down to pick up a rock could make you look smaller and more vulnerable, also you'd have to stop your retreat to do it  Brad Weinstein apologies for my overly dramatic response - was attempting to be funny but clearly failed! I wondered about that myself and these were thoughts in my head trying to figure it out. Serious contemplation at first and then making up ridiculous scenarios  I'm annoyed that ""a local official with Utah's Division of Wildlife Resources, Scott Root, told Burgess: ""You did awesome.'"" He didn't do ""awesome."" He never should have approached the cubs to begin with. He caused the entire encounter, stressing the mamma and cubs. He did not intentionally come upon the cubs, give him a break there. He saw them at a distance and as he was backing off momma showed up. Hey guys, this random person knows more than the wildlife experts!

A smart person doesn’t mess with wildlife babies. The mother is always nearby.  Danika Hyssong I lived a few blocks from Kyle(the guy in this video) a few years ago.

Colleen O'Brien thank you... I was just wondering. I didn’t want this coming back to my regular account.  Well. You put it on Facebook so if you do it and it is illegal, you just admitted to a crime.

Look at the triggered racists calling us racists for standing up to them.

It is a mistake to give any of their foolishly hate-filled socio-political fictions any traction at all..Acknowledging the racist concepts that bedevil the Democrats only legitimizes them..Refusing to legitimize the Democrats insistence on institutionalizing demographic bigotry is a beacon of hope in a free nation Caroline Evans I think you get the prize for most hate filled post today.

NEW DEBATE Would you rather know how you die or when you die? ,"I was with Amit but after thinking about it. I think I agree with David. Knowing when you die doesn’t mean folks will live their life to the fullest. Especially if the date seems distant. When you’re young, you tend to think about your death as a distant reality. I think the inevitability of our death but the uncertainty of when definitely produces anxiety. But that doesn’t mean that anxiety can’t push us to do things that otherwise we wouldn’t do. The fact that we could die today, tomorrow, a month, two decades can be a major factor for how folks choose to live their lives. Think about all the times you’ve procrastinated on a paper or an assignment. Only to then submit it at 11:59 before the deadline. The knowledge of the deadline makes it so you’re able to squander time. Thinking any day could be your last would have a way of pushing folks to live life to the fullest (which isn’t different from the squo), but I feel like people don’t live life to the fullest precisely because they see death a distant future Carlos Miguel Astacio so if you think the date won’t necessarily make humans live life to the fullest do you think knowing how does anything productive when it comes to death? or are both just not really the best to have full disclosure of Amit Kukreja tbh, the latter. I think knowing how is also pretty rough from a living life to the fullest perspective. Because it takes an already existing source anxiety (the certainty that we will all certainly perish regardless of when or how) and amplifies it by giving you a precise object for one to be anxious about (the whole convo y’all had about avoiding restaurants and air travel).  And if anything. I would add. Knowing the cause of ones death will do nothing to quell the anxiety we experience from our impending/inevitable deaths. You can know you’ll die in a car crash but you’ll never know how it feels to die in a car crash till your ticket gets punched. And once you do, won’t ever live to tell the tale.",
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse used his time during the confirmation hearings to lay out what he called the connections between dark-money groups and the conservative judiciary — while urging Amy Coney Barrett to act against those practices.,"He did such a fantastic job articulating the connections, and making an important case for additional scrutiny and reform.  Katherine Wolcher He proved too much.  His side does the same.   Jeffrey Stuart can you prove your assertion? Jeffrey Stuart so you agree that there needs to be scrutiny and reform? Is so that means we can start with her then.  Jeffrey Stuart, we all know that politics involves MONEY. It's not about whether or not ALL sides are in the money... but what they are doing specifically with that money. Sure... political entities use similar 'vehicles' to execute their agendas, but all of the agendas are NOT the 'same'. People need to LEARN to choose carefully. Both parties may use some of the same 'tools'... but no, they are NOT the same. Jeffrey Stuart You are right. It is a disease in the whole of government. This is the reason someone like Barrett would make the situation even more dangerous. Jeffrey Stuart prove it then, please. Katherine he really did. I wish more people could understand the importance of what he is saying. The way he presented everything was so well said and articulate I'm shocked that people in that very room werent applauding Mark Jacobi Just as well as he proved his assertions.   If you think this is just a problem on the right, bless your heart.   Jeffrey Stuart whitehouse showed his work. Your turn.  Jeffrey Stuart Yeah, no one is blaming Barrett, just the process that brought her to nomination. Where has this guy been all my life???  This was the perfect way to question this candidate and to bring these things to light.  Clearly she is going to be confirmed.  Be like Senator Whitehouse and use your time constructively.  Well done! He’s been great for quite some time now, but I couldn’t agree more about his performance.    Jane Hendrick Seidel if she has an ounce the “integrity” she boasts about, after this presentation, I would like for her to show it by removing herself.
